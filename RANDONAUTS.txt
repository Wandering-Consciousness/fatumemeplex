Steps to graph the word vectors of the Randonauts subreddit:
===

Get software:
---

$ git clone https://github.com/simonnishi/fatumemeplex.git (private fork of https://github.com/anvaka/pm/)
$ git clone https://github.com/anvaka/word2vec-graph
Download GloVe and follow the build instructions. Don't need to bother with running demo.sh unless you want to.
Get latest /r/randonauts subreddit data (for now BlueSkies sourced it for me as a CSV). Will assume it's called subdata_10_30_2019.csv. Place it in the GloVe folder.

Prepping the CSV file:
---

Open the CSV file in OpenOffice Calc or Excel etc and delete all the columns except Title and Post Body (TODO: review/discuss this step)
Delete the 1st line (column headers). Save CSV.
In VIM I ran the following commands to remove some text/lines of metadata etc I figure we don't need:
%g/^&amp/d
%g/^\*Processing img/d
%g/^http/d
%g/^\[/d   (for [label](http....) type links on one line
TODO: remove in-paragraph URLs/links?
TODO: remove emojis and other stuff?
%s/"//g
Save file.

Convert everything to lower case:
$ tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' < subdata_10_30_2019.csv > subdata_10_30_2019_lower.csv 
$ vi subdata_10_30_2019_lower.csv 

Dirty hack to remove articles and small words:
TODO: should really think carefully about what words to exclude...
:%s/ an / /g
Repeat for other words like:
a, the, if, of, in, it, i, at, i'm, was, is, be, am, was, ...
Also repeat commands for the same words at the beginning of a line with no space:
:%s/^to //g
Save

Training the model with GlOve:
---

cd to GloVe's dir
$ cp demo.sh randonauts.sh
$ vi it and:
Delete the make....fi lines that download text8.zip and unzip it.
Change CORPUS=text8 to CORPUS=subdata_10_30_2019_lower.csv
Change MEMORY=4.0 to something lower if you machine doesn't have much memory (my Mac only has 8GB and I was getting Bus Errors when it crashed). I set it to 2.0.
TODO: Investigate fine-tuning the other parameters

Also I commented out this line:
 python eval/python/evaluate.py
Because I was getting this error and didn't yet find the cause:

$ cp vectors.txt ../word2vec-graph/graph-data/

Run word2vec-graph (based on "Local setup" instructions in its README)
---

Make sure node.js is installed.
Install https://github.com/spotify/annoy

cd word2vec-graph
npm install
python save_text_edges.py --input_vectors graph-data/vectors.txt --out_file graph-data/edges.txt --dimensions 50
node edges2graph.js graph-data/edges.txt
Lastly, I changed:
node --max-old-space-size=12000 layout.js
to
node --max-old-space-size=2000 layout.js
because node crashed with not enough memory :) 

Setup Graph Visualizing
---
cd ../pm/
npm i
npm start
Then kill the server with Ctrl+C. build/ subfolder should be created now.
mkdir -p build/data/randonauts/2019-10-31T00-00-00Z
cp -rf ../word2vec-graph/graph-data/* ../word2vec-graph/graph-layout/* build/data/randonauts/2019-10-31T00-00-00Z

vi build/data/randonauts/manifest.json and add:
{
  "all": [
    "2019-10-31T00-00-00Z"
  ],
  "last": "2019-10-31T00-00-00Z"
}

vi src/config.js and change:
export default {
  dataUrl: '//anvaka.github.io/galactic-data/'
};
to
export default {
  dataUrl: '/data/'
};

npm start
