"Randonaut Trip Report from Brentwood, California (United States of America)",2019-11-22,"Mystery Point Generated X-C5253154 (37.910704 -121.714985) What 3 words address: [looks.doorway.fragmented](https://what3words.com/looks.doorway.fragmented) Report: it was a point along my normal walking route, but down a steep embankment to a creek, at a secluded pool of murky water surrounded by tall trees that shielded the area from the outside world. The point was at a tree growing horizontally, partway down the slope. I had to carefully traverse the steep dry earthen bank over the pool. The side was covered with dead leaves and only dirt lumps to hold onto. It was a peaceful and quiet place, just tucking in to the coming winter. I waited in hiding for a jogger to pass and then climbed over to the tree from the tiny deer trail I had followed down. If I had slipped, I would have gotten soaked and muddy and have to explain my contidtion to others and possibly damage my phone, field recorder or headphones, so I was more than a little nervous and took my time. I left a sigil/medicine bag under the tree in a small animal's burrow and then climbed back to the road, and continued on my walk to the end of the trail and back. It is a normally busy trail, but unusually empty so I was able to get to and from the point seemingly without being noticed. On my return trip, I was looking for an artifact to take and spotted an interesting greenish acorn and litter. Just as I stopped to pick it up, a biker and his dog that had already passed earlier rode by again. I also left runestones along my route in slightly out of the way plots for others to find and take if they were curious enough. My intentions were freedom, universal love and progress in the face of all obstacles, fear and dogmatic resistance.

Had to calm my nerves on the walk over. Not too scared or anything just trying to be hyper aware of anything that might happen. A truck driving by with a washing machine slowed down near me as i walked to the point. I honestly thought they were going to get out and ask me a question. I was a little scared but i kept walking on, determined. The truck eventually put it in reverse and started backing up in an arch behind me. I didnt look back. I was too freaked out. Around the halfway mark to the point I smelled a sweet smell, almost like candy in a mall. It made me think of when I was a kid around the holidays. On the way back from the point this same area no longer had a sweet smell but a burning smell, like a fireplace fire. At the point I looked around for about 10 minutes, feeling kind of awkward since it was in someones front yard and lots of cars were passing by. I picked up my two pieces of trash/artifacts from around the area. I had my flashlight to try and see anything, but nothing was really there except a couple trees and the rest of the houses yard. So many cars passed by and I felt super weird loitering by myself, in the dark with a flashlight looking for god knows what. I decided to give up and walk back home. The walk home was a little spooky. The leaves were really rustling, and I stopped to check behind me once or twice. Overall I feel fine. Im satisfied with the experience, but next time Ill do it during the day.

The point I visited put me smack in the middle of the sort of place I've been trying to avoid most of my adult life, a staunch Protestant estate complete with murals on each street end. In fact this particular street I had walked past before when I used to live only 5 minutes away and had it explicitly noted in my mind as a dodgy looking street, avoid. Now in Northern Ireland you normally want to avoid such a place if you're a Catholic or wanted by paramilitary types. I'm neither. I was raised a Prod but due to growing insight and understanding I soon distanced myself from the entire sectarian debacle during my teens but more recently have been educating myself on Irish tradition and mythology to a point of bias against how I was raised which goes quite against the rules I have set for myself on being an individual and neutral party, this trip woke me up to that bias which has been forming in me so now I may right it. An insightful trip for me personally.

Visited two of three points as one was in the water. Nothing of interest at either point but did end up going down a lot of streets in the neighborhood near preschool that I hadn't been down before even though I've intentionally ridden my bike around this place randomly many times before. On the way home down a street I've been down many times before I discovered a grafitti mural on the wall of a house car garage. In big letters it said HOME with a picture of an ocean sunset and a little character beside saying ""I'm still here"". I don't know how long it's been here but I thought I would have noticed it before. Graffiti is quite rare in Japan, even more so an actual artistic piece in a nice urban area.
