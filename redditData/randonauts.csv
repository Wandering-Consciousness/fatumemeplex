field report (3-17-2019): three attractor points.,2019-03-18,"2 subjects and 1 dog. ages 26, 17 and 2. created the first attractor point while focusing on ""a new or changed world that [we] would want to inhabit."" (i envisioned a world same as this one except i have a [redacted] and a [redacted]. sister envisioned world where all animals roamed free and nobody had any worries.) all travel takes place on foot. notes on travel from starting location to first attractor point: experienced a high amount of noise and chaotic distraction in the form of dogs barking. noticed two dogs that were not on their leashes that usually were. notes on first attractor point: power(2.23) timestamp(1820) the location was inside of a blue house. house was occupied, though looked abandoned aside from the comparatively new car in its garage. actions taken at first attractor point: circled around the block through an alley that led to the back yard of the house. yard was empty asides from a tree stump. yard was fenced in shoddy wire, but had an opening. we entered the back yard from the alley and walked through it and through the front yard back onto the street in front of the house. knocked on door and asked if ""margaret"" was home. she was not. generated new attractor point. notes on travel to second attractor point: witnessed 3 more dogs not on leashes, and saw a dog get hit by a car. a child who apparently owned the dog was crying. we ran up and the childs parents approached by car, the ones who hit the dog drove away. i picked up the dog, who seemed unable to walk, and offered to put it in the parents car. dog weighed about 40 pounds and bit me in the face as i was walking it to the car. i picked it up again, differently this time and stowed it in the car. notes on second attractor point: power(5.62) timestamp(1851) point was again in the back end of an occupied house that had an abandoned ""feel"" to it. house was heavily accented with blue, but was mostly white. house had two comparatively new vehicles under carport. noticed a sign that read ""drive slow children"" on a phone pole in the yard. note: when we tried to make a third attractor point, recieved message; attractor invalid. power 0.9. we decided to generate another attractor point. notes on travel to third attractor point: witnessed 6 more dogs not on leashes, running around freely. noticed old two blue houses i had never noticed before, even though i had been in this part of town several times. noticed a radio song playing over intercom that spoke ""die alive"" (this only confirmed by my sister, i couldn' make out the words personally.) and ""i can tell how you feel about me."" (confirmed by both of us.) notes on third attractor point: power (2.54) timestamp (1927) point was near a christian church, with a sign in the yard that said ""under the blood ministries"" (it was pointed out that anecdotal correspondence between this sign and having the dog draw blood from my face could be made... especially since i was wearing a sweater that said ""celestial"") we walked out to a high grass area and found that the point nearly directly coincided with an open stryrofoam box that was nestled in the grass. box was empty aside from some dead leaves. i noticed an ornate white flower that stood out amidst the grass and put it into the box. we left the scene and ended the experiment. takeaway notes: nothing i could relate to my vision was at or on the way to any of the points. phenomena related to my sisters vision were apparent on the way to points but not at the points themselves. (to put into perspective, i have never in my 7 months living in this town seen more than two dogs off of their leash, it should be noted heavily that this was an incredible aspect of the experience.) my vision was no different from where i'm at now aside from me owning a couple more things. sisters was like an entire utopia, very unlikely to manifest, yet the experience overall was much more inclined towards her imagined scenario. my takeaway was that it is useless to try and constrain your imagination to the confines of what you believe probable or possible for the sake of increasing the chances of its manifestation. end report."
field report: 4.11 attractor,2019-03-18,"this afternoon i needed a break from work and the weather was nice, so i generated an attractor within a 3000 meter radius. it had a power of 4.11 and was on an [old airport field that is now a public ""park""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/berlin_tempelhof_airport). i've been there many times before, but the attractor ended up way off where most people usually go, as far south as possible (i.e. away from the city center, away from all the bbq spots and open-air cafs and quite far from the nearest entrance, too). it's not that no one is ever there, plenty of runners will have passed it and such, but it's not where people usually are just to hang out. i for one had never been there before. so anyway, on the way there the first meaningful thing i saw was [a graffiti saying ""schau""](https://i.postimg.cc/rhn2sfmb/img-20190318-162805.jpg), meaning any one of ""look [verb; singular 2nd person imperative]"", ""show [noun]"", ""vision"" or ""intuition [noun]"". so if i wasn't keeping an eye out before, i certainly was now. by now the weather was not as good anymore, some clouds started gathering in front of me. i also passed by a small skate park next to some small building which i had never seen before. i [took](https://i.postimg.cc/jtvvgl7b/img-20190318-162904.jpg) some [pictures](https://i.postimg.cc/sd5dkfhq/img-20190318-162923.jpg) of [it](https://i.postimg.cc/cm3xjnzb/img-20190318-162936.jpg), but suddenly my phone just turned itself off, despite the battery being at fifty-something percent. i restarted it, but as soon as i went into the camera, it immediately died again. so apparently i wasn't supposed to take any further pictures. i started the phone again to check more precisely where the attractor was, which worked. as i continued walking towards the attractor, the weather got considerably rougher, with pretty strong wind hitting me head on. now, this isn't unusual given that it's a vast open field, it's early springtime and i live in northern/middle europe, but the shift from sun and a mild breeze to dark clouds and a wind that almost felt hostile was quite quick and significant. i passed an abandoned, preserved and quite spooky looking waste incineration plant built by the us air force, with the graffiti ""tlake"" on a concrete block next to it. stupidly, i tried to take a picture of it, but of course that didn't fly. this time i couldn't even restart my phone, it just died while booting. so i got to regret that pretty quickly. as i got closer to where i assumed/remembered the attractor to be, it started raining. in the direction of the rest of the field, there was a power station. it had the signs ""station 22"", ""trafo 22"" (apparently meaning ""transformer"" in turkish) and ""126"" on the outside. the door was locked. on the other side of the path i was walking on, there was a fence. if i remembered correctly, the attractor was basically on the fence or maybe even sliiightly on the other side of it, so i mostly directed my attention in that direction. on the other side was a really run-down community garden. most of the sheds looked like they would fall apart by just being touched, except for one relatively large house in sapphire blue. naturally i couldn't come any closer, but i looked for any other anomalies or notable phenomena or objects in the area, unfortunately unsuccessfully, before heading back. as i passed the waste incineration plant, both the rain and wind stopped and the sun returned. and as i was waiting for the subway, i tried starting my phone again, without any problems whatsoever."

field report: two attractor points (with pictures),2019-03-20,"today i did a solo trek to two attractor points and stumbled upon some incredible stuff! methodology: focus mind on a type of reality i want to phase into. generate attractor point while mind is focused. the world i envisioned was high octane, high action and hardcore. details not included so as not to interfere with manifestation. notes on travel to first attractor point: none notes on first attractor point: it was behind an apartment building and over a barbed wire fence with several ""no trespassing"" signs posted to it. [here](https://imgur.com/fb6luvd) it is. not pictured but noted was that the fence dividing line marked a stark shift in height of the land, so that the side i was on was much higher than the the other side of the fence. this influenced my decision to *not* go over it, because the fence was only like 3 feet tall from my side, but coming back over, the fence would have been like 5 feet tall. (and made of barbed wire, would have been a real bitch to cross.) at this point i made set this area to new location and made another attractor point using same methodology as posted above. notes on travel to second attractor point: i was effectively leaving town at this point, and the flavor of scenery was shifting rather vividly. everything was getting all.. backwater and kinda spooky. notes on second attractor point: wow, i had never known [this building](https://imgur.com/j0t0qmj) or any like it to be around [here!](https://imgur.com/hiulsrb) the point was in the back of it, and as soon as i entered the building, i saw [this](https://imgur.com/xv3oq1y) on the floor! i was under time constraints and so couldn't explore the [spacious](https://imgur.com/lkts1ag) and [two storied](https://imgur.com/krtxp9z) building which had many rooms. what was nuts though is that i went under the stairwell and into this little janitor cubby-type room. it was pitch dark in here, nothing but my phone light to guide. i rounded the corner of the room (it was an 'l' shaped room) and ran smack into [**this!**](https://imgur.com/cbxkcgo) i checked it out a bit.. and it *seemed* fake, but i wasn't able to examine it all that clearly before i heard this thumping noise coming from somewhere that startled me. i hit my head on the ceiling and it made a sound.. and then i heard another sound and was noped tf outta there."

field report: the legendary drum attractor,2019-03-20,"we are getting many many reports that attractors are, well, attracted to dead ends, the middle of lakes, parks. places that are ""off the beaten path"" as far as the usual energy of the city goes. these in-between zones have the potential for anomalous activity. obviously if your point is right in front of someones house, its best not to go trespassing on their property. but, if there happens to be a wild in between zone nearby.... keep in mind attractors look like this : https://i.imgur.com/siexun7.jpg and the attractor point is the exact center of one of those purple circles. attractor is really a point by definition, because its a place where the points are attracted. but physically it can be a zone. so if you find an attractor with an ""in between"" sort of wild zone near by, i highly recommend exploring that area because it could very well contain anomalous activity that is untouched by the natural flow of every day energy in that urban environment. like when i came to the legendary drum attractor point, the gps didn't lead me straight to the drum. if you only go by google maps, most of the time it will lead you to the nearest address of the coordinate point. sometimes going off the beaten path is preferred. the attractor point at first glance looked like this https://i.imgur.com/x7d3otu.jpg which was a very inviting trailhead. almost like i was being pulled into another world, where mystery and adventure awaited. i even commented in the randonauts chat at this point, ""hmm wonder whats down this path??"" i followed the path about 20 feet to a steep drop off and drainage area https://i.imgur.com/lg1kb2z.jpg https://i.imgur.com/39ofegs.jpg in the second photo you can just almost see the drum. it was in the tree at the top left corner just out of frame. after i took this photo it caught my eye, and it stood out so much i thought i must not be seeing correctly. i was sure it was a piece of trash in the shape of a drum. but after a little bush whacking, sure enough, there it was https://i.imgur.com/uehqcjr.jpg i left the drum where it was, as it seemed purposefully placed there and i didn't want to disturb anyone's ritual area. i did however sit down and play on it for a bit, which felt very spooky and cool like i was communing with this ghost in the machine that had led me here. the area where i found the drum will remain under observation. https://i.imgur.com/hrvzs8r.jpg i suppose i want to encourage you all the explore the entire zone around an attractor point. and don't expect your google maps gps to take you to the exact coordinates, as i said earlier it will most likely bring you to a house nearest the coordinates, and thats no good. the more you drift the more you will get a sense of the energy flow of your area, and you will begin to see how the ""in between"" zones that are sort of hidden away from the normal everyday hustle and bustle. it seems these zones are fruitful for exploring."
anonymous field report,2019-03-20,"i went to a 5.96, it was outside a house on a street i'd never been on, in a neighborhood. i went at night though about 9:30pm, i figured its better to go to these points around the time they're found, instead of waiting until later. i only stuck around for like 2 minutes because i kept feeling like someone would call the cops on some creepy dude standing around their house at night. so, i didn't really stay long enough to look around for some kind of object, although i didn't really see any. the point itself on the map was about 10 feet away from where i was. it was in the middle of their front yard. the main thing that stood out to me was the sky/moon. for some reason the moon and sky looked more 'real' on that street. i went there on an electric skateboard since i don't drive. it was about 2.3 miles from where i live. i left when the neighboring house had someone come out to their car. nothing out of the ordinary other than the feelings i was getting. there was a sign on the way there that had a misprint. instead of road it said oad, and someone wrote a t where the r should've been. next time i'll try going to one in the day. i would try going to multiple in one day but i'll have to stop every so often and charge my board at some fast food place or something. the despair meme is real, the entire time i was fighting negative thoughts. i just started humming a positive/happy song the entire time."
newbie here..in theory,2019-03-28,"i'm new to the sub as of this morning, but have had my mind on these things for years now and felt like this sub fell in my lap for a reason. i'm reading the history)theory stuff on this and largely a lot of it's back-history i'm already aware of (though not in some contexts) and i'm curious how this came to me. what background do you all come from and how has it helped you map this stuff? i believe that the ""keys to the kingdom"" are being passed down to the younger among us, and i suspect many of you are probably younger and smarter than i! how do i go about learning this more deeply? i see it's effects daily (specially the despair meme) and i'm curious to understand it all a little better. personally i feel we shouldnt tinker with it, but again, i don't think i'm the chosen generation for this info, just a leftover from a previous generation meant to help you all take the torch! ;-)"

16th experiment on achieving zero causal viscosity,2019-03-30,"**an experiment on achieving zero causal viscosity** *number 16* &amp;#x200b; a scan for repellers was commenced, in the bounds of the city, during 20 days, real time. on day 15, the appearance of an anomalously powerful repeller was noted. it consistently reappeared in several rounds throughout the scan. upon arrival, the team encountered a partly abandoned factory workshop. the degree of its abandonment (at the moment of the mission) is reported differently across participants. one expeditionary claimed that he has talked with one of the workers and *received a bundle of keys from him*. this bundle of keys, as a physical object, has later been used to access otherwise inaccessible rooms at the facility. upon reaching the epicenter of the repeller, participants noted an unusually high frequency of shifts. expeditionaries reported objects changing in their field of attention not less frequent than half a minute. then, in around 10-15 minutes, this stopped. among those objects are (*as reported*): an udentified smartphone (cracked screen), a bathtub, a toy model of the eiphel tower, a hammer, a horse plush. this phenomenon was later commonly described as ""adjustment of reality"", or ""stabilization of perception"". it resembles some kind of ""perceptual dizziness"", when, upon entering a certain area, a person cannot quite perceive ""boundaries"" of objects, and so cannot identify them at first. different participants reported this effect differently, in terms of length and in terms of intensity. although, collective and simultaneous nature of the effect is of no doubt. the team had to leave the location hastily, as some workers have seemingly reported team's presence to security personnel. however, three expeditionaries remained at the facility, and later told the story that is presented in annex 16-1. **zero viscosity annex 16-1** three remaining expeditionaries (allegedly) used keys from the above-mentioned bundle to open a door to yet another section of the workshop. at this section, they encountered another group of workers, who ""*behaved friendly/neutral for some reason*"". then, workers ""*invited all three of us to work with their machinery, and we smhw agreed and it was like a hypnotic state. it was like a mass psychosis and all of us there workers and us were in this shit together""*. as a result, using the machinery, expeditionaries ""produced"" an item which appears to be a part of an ""air handling unit"" (a hvac air coil)\*, according to our research. this description is a result of a vague consensus between all three members, as their personal reports were contradictory to each other and even sometimes self-contradictory. while reporting, they felt ""uncomfortable"" and ""dizzy"". \_ \*this item, to this day, remains at the team's hq, and is used in hq's handmade air conditioning system."
field report: water everywhere?,2019-04-03,"i'll start by saying that, living in sardinia, very close to the sea, most of the points we're getting from the bot are right in the middle of the water. a couple of days ago i got an interesting one, and since it's pretty near to my house, me and my girlfriend decided to go take a look. *processing img 1vnv4pvytxp21...* what may look like fields are what we call ""saline"", they are basically big ponds of water used to extract salt from the seawater and, as far as i know, they've been sitting there for ages. the road that we were gonna use to get there was actually closed with a big gate, padlock and all, but we jumped over the fence and started walking. https://i.redd.it/w59l2exiuxp21.jpg despite how the photo looks, the road was very dark and we could barely see what we were stepping on. the huge lights you can see in the middle of the picture are the ones from our local stadium, where a big soccer match was being played. while we were walking towards the point (and thus the lights), an old man dressed in black and wearing a winter cap passed us by, but it was so dark that we noticed him when he was very close to us, so my girlfriend got a little scared for a moment, but we laughed it off. the whole walk was actually pretty calm and serene, and made us feel very relaxed. we could also hear ducks and other birds singing and diving into the near pond, and it was actually pretty funny. just when i was starting to think we were gonna find nothing, right on the shores of where the point was showing on our google maps, we found this thing: *processing img afn0o3kcwxp21...* i had to turn up the brightness a lot to even make it visible (it was very dark!), but here it is! it's a sturdy wooden building, probably being used for birdwatching, it's open and you can go inside. we took a couple pics. *processing img xs2vnnkqwxp21...* *processing img w6o2gpkqwxp21...* *processing img u9kn6lkqwxp21...* there's not much else to say, actually. unfortunately nothing was found on the site, literally nothing, so we couldn't grab anything, not even garbage. we somewhat take it for granted, but people tend to be pretty clean and respectful around these parts. well, apart from the love graffiti on the walls of this little house. no feelings of despair were felt. it was actually a very pleasant walk and i think we'll visit more points in the next days. will keep you posted."
took dog on a walk to two locations,2019-04-03,"sadly, theres no legendary artifacts for you guys, but some mildly interesting stuff happened. the first location (2.19) was across the street from a park i used to read at years ago, behind a church. ive walked my dog near that park several times, encountering several barking dogs near there (normally theres no barking) and what sounded like a bell being rung a few blocks away (not anywhere near this church, and its after midnight anyway, so the bells would not be ringing). my dog became kinda agitated, and started pulling in any other direction except that church. i finally got her to calm down, and we approached. after scoping out the area for awhile, and not finding anything interesting, i pulled another location (3.09) that was just a few blocks from the church, and conveniently along a route that loops right back to my apartment. as im walking towards the location, the breeze starts getting much stronger. it quickly went from feeling like a cool spring night, to being kinda uncomfortable. about half a block from the location, a car alarm starts going off in the distance. the second location was a nondescript spot on the street, just in front of a house, and i likely would have missed it entirely if it werent for the dog starting to jerk me around again. as i continued back to my apartment, the breeze went back as it was before, and there were no more dogs barking or noises in the distance. a few things i took away from this: 1) i really need to try this during the day so its easier to make out my surroundings, preferably without the dog to distract me (tho her behavior was definitely interesting, cus shes normally really well behaved when shes out on a walk); 2- im not sure if it was from me hyping myself up beforehand while talking about this with my friend or if it was something else, but i definitely felt something as i approached these spots; 3) regardless of any weirdness that may be associated with this, i really did appreciate following the bots directions and checking these places out. even if there was no oddly functioning moped, legendary tree drum, or piss bottles (which is odd, since i definitely live in the kinda neighborhood where this is normalish to see), it was cool to walk to places i would never just choose to go on my own."

"saturday run, first journey",2019-04-06,"i like to run on saturdays, and i usually jog 3-4 miles at a nearby track. this time i decided i would generate an attractor point to see what's there then return to the track to continue the rest of my run. i used a private instance of the bot to generate a point. i got some early despair meme bad vibes before i even started, because my wife was watching a true crime show and there was a reference to someone dying in a car accident as i was generating the first point. shit, will i get hit by a car if i do this??? anyway, the point was in london, and i realized i needed to reset the default location, lol. so i did that and got a point too far for a simple jog. i reduced the radius to 1,000 meters and tried again. while generating the point i visualized some random objects i'd lost back in college: a metal cigarette lighter, a blue track jacket with white trim and a penguin logo, and a pair of brown sandals. i figured if i somehow found one of those objects here at an attractor, on the other side of the country from where i went to college, that would be some crazy-legendary stuff to happen. so i get a point, power 5.23, about 800 meters away. it's a beautiful sunny day with some big white clouds as i set out for my run and start up my running playlist (\~300 songs that i like to play on random). i'm feeling some despair meme anxiety, but the first song that plays is that ""scared of the dark"" song from the *spider-man: into the spider-verse* soundtrack. i feel like a song about not being afraid from a movie about the multiverse is a *cool sign*. it gets me pumped and i start my journey. halfway to the point there is a bunch of gusts of strong wind. this is pretty normal weather for this time of year, and i laugh at the thought that it is the universe trying to stop me from going down a strange new path. i get to the point and it's behind a church. there's a ""no trespassing"" sign (photo), so i get nervous and worry that i shouldn't be standing around in a parking lot. i closed my private instance before i left the house, but i decide i'll get a new attractor point from the telegram room's bot to try again. it's a 5.55 in front of some house. i continue on. &amp;#x200b; [stay away!](https://i.redd.it/m1yi7wkfzpq21.jpg) on the way there i see a neighborhood called ""legendary estates."" i thought of the folks in the chat joking about legendary artifacts and laughed. i snapped a photo. &amp;#x200b; [legendary estates](https://i.redd.it/m9u0gc5bzpq21.jpg) i jog further and see an old couple out for a walk (photo). as i pass them i get this weird fear that they won't have faces. like the simulation hasn't rendered them yet. it is dumb, but i don't look back just to be safe. &amp;#x200b; [the faceless elderly!?](https://i.redd.it/jpg5vm0wzpq21.jpg) i get to the point and it's totally ordinary. just regular houses. &amp;#x200b; [pacific northwest spring vibes...](https://i.redd.it/nwc45a2n2qq21.jpg) i jog in place for a bit and take some photos. nothing too special. there's a crushed white plastic thing that is maybe part of an electronic (photo). sorry the photo is so shitty. i felt really self-conscious taking photos in public for some reason. i don't grab it. i grab a pebble from the ground as an artifact instead. the pebble looked special to me. &amp;#x200b; https://i.redd.it/ulle6126zpq21.jpg a cool version of *schala's theme* starts on my playlist. it's a rad tune from *chrono trigger*, an old snes game that i was obsessed with as a kid, lol (90s kids, amirite?). i take it as a *cool* *sign* and generate another attractor point. i get a series of three really weak ones. then i get a 2.53 on the road i took towards point number two. i head back that way, because it'll get me closer to the track where i normally run. i go past the point and then turn down the road where i think it is. somehow i went too far. the point was actually at this stump i ran past. i remember seeing it and thinking ""cool stump, it's shaped like a hexagon."" for whatever reason, i don't jog the 100 yards back, maybe it's fear of looking weird running back and forth, i decide i'll get a new attractor instead. i get a 2.27 near the school where i usually run. i start that way. i pass the church from point one on the way there and realize i can run around to the other side of the parking lot to get closer to the original point. i see a dude in a hoodie with an angry dog chilling in the lot. when i head towards that area he goes behind a nearby fence. i think he was just walking his dog. i do some backwards running because i read an article about how that's good to do sometimes to help movement. i'm some dude running backwards circles in an empty church parking lot. then i continue. i get to the point and there's a big wooden cross, lol. i snap a photo. &amp;#x200b; [jesus, lol](https://i.redd.it/pn5l6tt50qq21.jpg) i get back on my journey to point four, the one by the school. so far this whole journey i've been seeing so much random trash. like it's everywhere (photo). &amp;#x200b; [trash and nature](https://i.redd.it/oi16fprh1qq21.jpg) bottles, cans, paper, plastic bags, a few explanations occur to me: 1. humanity is garbage, and we ruin the planet by leaving our shit everywhere. 2. if we're living in a simulation, and i'm going off my normal path, the simulation is just grabbing random assets from its collection and dumping them on the ground to make it *feel real*. 3. i'm paying attention to my surroundings like 100 times more than i normally would in everyday life. any other run, i'd tune into my music, run in some big circles, get sweaty, and head home. this time i'm looking at every single thing in my environment and wondering what the significance is. like when you're high and you watch a movie and you pick out all the possible things in the frame and wonder what it means. why did they put that there in the shot? is it symbolism? on this run i'm seeing all kinds of ""no trespassing"" and ""don't go here"" signs, and it's like, damn, all these signs trying to tell me where to go. i'mna go where i go. i like explanation #3 a lot. that you see so much more when you're in the moment and taking it all in. it means what you think it means. it makes me want to explore more. *obstacle 1* by interpol is playing on the way. it's a dope song from the early 2000s. i pass the school and get closer to the point. on the way i see a soggy blue and white hat with the words ""bayview roofing"" on it (photo). i pick it up briefly, but i feel really bad grabbing it. like the owner might want his fucked up hat back? no idea why, but i set it back down. &amp;#x200b; [the blue hat](https://i.redd.it/pew9dv7l1qq21.jpg) i get to the point. it's next to a stream by a series of apartment buildings. the road ends at a sign and i look down to where the point is, next to the stream. there are a bunch of thorny vines blocking the path. i see a bright pink purse. i climb through the vines and get close enough to see a bunch of random shit here. more garbage, lol. this stuff is from a spencer's gifts, it looks like a mid 2000s scene girl exploded into objects. i turn over the pink purse and pink house insulation pours out. wtf? like the stuff you'd have in the walls of a house. who put that in a bag and tossed it here? for a moment i was worried i'd find a dead body or something, sitting in the stream. it spooked me out. i took some photos and climbed back to the run. i see another dude in a dark hoodie with a mean looking dog on my run back to normal roads. it weirded me out to see another dude with a dog. once i got back to the main road, i decide i'll do a few laps at the school track then head home. &amp;#x200b; *processing img qki6cu7q1qq21...* &amp;#x200b; [the pink purse](https://i.redd.it/iyc8t23t1qq21.jpg) &amp;#x200b; [the contents of the pink purse](https://i.redd.it/q3tjyfnu1qq21.jpg) i see the soggy blue and white hat and bring myself to take it 100 meters to set it on top of an electrical box. i guess someone else will see it. &amp;#x200b; https://i.redd.it/0a7x4h6w1qq21.jpg i run some laps. do some backwards running, too. i see a gray hat on the infield of the track. i think about that expression ""i lost my hat"" that people say when something baffles them. there's even more garbage on the side of the track. a big styrofoam block. there are wild flowers, too. it's a beautiful day. i usually love being outside and exercising, but this trip was extra awesome despite the garbage. &amp;#x200b; [me and my pebble friend taking in some outdoor vibes](https://i.redd.it/a15ae9u42qq21.jpg) &amp;#x200b; [flowers are dope](https://i.redd.it/q32gau7x1qq21.jpg) i finish running around the track and head home. i see a third hat on the ground on the way. lol, a lot of people losing their hat, i guess. it's been a fun journey full of weird observations. about 100 meters from the end of the run i see, guess what, more trash. a teal sharpie marker and... a **red lighter**. whoa, i grab it. it doesn't work, but i take it as a second artifact. it's not like the metal one i thought of originally, but it has a cap which is a sort of similar design. there's a dragon logo on it. &amp;#x200b; [this means something?](https://i.redd.it/mahs3e112qq21.jpg) holding it feels super weird. like i want to get rid of it after having it only a minute. i resist the impulse and keep it. i put it in a bag with my pebble from earlier. this bag will hold my finds. i know people toss discarded lighters all the time, so like, it's not a totally crazy thing to find, but it is *one of the things* i thought about when i set out on the journey. **very cool.** &amp;#x200b; tl;dr: there's a lot of garbage out there, and a lot of beauty if you take the time to look and appreciate it. will do again. :)"
first trip,2019-04-06,so i jumped into this with two feet without a lot of research... my first attractor site was 7 minutes from my location. i ended up in the middle of an apartment complex. the funny part is i've been planning on moving to a new apartment. no idea if the two are related. i need to understand this a lot more than i do.

fatum frequently asked questions. feel free to contribute questions/answers in this thread! newbies welcome!,2019-04-07,"what is fatum? a derministic fate and its byproducts what are attractors, repellers, and quantum random points? attractors are like the blue zones, abnormally dense amount of random points within the radius. repellers are like the yellow. from the perspective of statistics both are anomalies of same kind. quantum random points are like their name suggests, random. what is /getpseudo? /getpseudo relies on your hardware to generate a random point, rather than harnessing the quantum random number generator api. what kind of things can i expect to find in attractor points? what about repeller points? basically this is what we are gathering data on. certainly anything is possible. how does this random number generator give you a location? it generates a scatter of r*appi random points in the selected zone. then it repeatedly calculates an average point coordinates and decreases the radius around it . so the circle becomes smaller on each iteration and its center is moving in the direction of the maximum density of the points. and when it became smaller than 10 meters, it's center is returned as an attractor point. what is an attractor point? we call it attractor because it literally attracts the random points. their deviation from the average expected value tends to this point. an improbable number of generated points clustered. what is a repeller point? repeller point is a point with an improbably low number of random points in the radius. what is the attractor point power level? density of points within attractor, relative to global density what is the maximum attractor point power level? there is a maximum, but you probably will never reach it. maximum is when all (radius*0.1) points will fall at the same spot. and the attractor radius is something like an average distance to nearest 10 points. so if they will be in the same spot, the radius will be 1 and the density will be radius*0.1 points per meter. divide it by average density of whole zone and it will be maximum basically: the absolute power maximum is radius squared. what does the power level mean? the higher the power level the more improbable that grouping of points. is an attractor a physical thing? it's not actually a place at all, its more a causal cascade, that creates itself through the quest vector, directed by the point in space-time, where the time is self-correlated by the asher- peres quantum loop, where the future is influencing the past in other words, you dont need to know the time. when you create attractor-point, you create the whole alternate timeline, that can influence probability of your choices from the potential future. thats how it creates probability deviation, that causes attractor to emerge at the first place. it's existence is itself a guarantee, that you will arrive to the place in a right time to initiate the cascade, that will create a future, that through entanglement will create an attractor point in the past"
new attractor found 430 metres away from an old node?,2019-04-07,"i fired up the locator beacon using the random numbers generated from my network. had a slight problem with the time based shift factor but updating to the latest patch of the firmware seemed to fix the diffraction node. a sprinkling of potassium salt water on the screen also helped. it guided me to a place about 430 metres northwest of the last attraction node i found which is funny because that was near a set of traffic lights. the last attractor i found was also near traffic lights, is it normal to have two fluxes by two of the same object within a 500m radius? couldnt find much in the guide about that. anyway, i carried on walking to the node as my sensor began to heat up in the usual way, and it began raining. pretty cool right! there was a metal bin near it and some writing on a piece of paper, couldnt work out what it said. ive been seeing traffic lights a lot recently, do you think its the network trying to tell me something? and is it normal to find a new node so near the site (~400m) of an old one?"

chaos magick and a postmodern world,2019-04-08,"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_invisibles has anyone here ever read *the invisibles*? its a comic created by grant morrison about a misfit group of freedom fighters in a world of government conspiracies, psychedelics and magick. grant morrison has said himself that this comic was intended to be a hypersigil, or a a living spell made of art that would alter the world to his liking. his vision of the world includes an apocalypse invoked by chaos magick. if youre not familiar with chaos magick its been described as traditional occult techniques and applied postmodernism. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/chaos_magic its kind of hard to define because its an idea rather than a set of rules. the core of chaos magick is that the practitioner is free to adopt whatever works for them, but it all basically boils down to the power of belief. meme magick could be considered another form of this practice. and if youre not familiar with meme magick either, please take the time to read the article below, because its affects on our society have been quite profound. these days, our whole culture is shaped by the internet. https://pepethefrogfaith.wordpress.com well anyways, grants vision of the world includes an apocalypse invoked by chaos magick. however, the end of the world is a good thing in the authors eyes because it marks a major transition in human consciousness and the birth of a new world - one the people create together. is that what were seeing in real time? are the people involved in this project like the invisibles? phillip k. dick, one of the first people to put forth the simulation theory, said that our reality is like a consensus or in other words, what we perceive as real is only real because we have all agreed that it is. https://youtu.be/0ldv8fm_r7g however, in our postmodern age, people disagree on just about everything: politics, climate change, conspiracies, gender, whether the news is fake or not, and even the shape of the planet. if the simulation is created by the average of our collective thoughts, it must be falling apart right now (i imagine this is directly linked to the mandela effect) - and what we are doing is the next step in that process. at least i believe so. tell me your thoughts."

first attractor point,2019-04-08,"so i grabbed a couple of attractor points and went about looking them up. first one, first time was rather interesting.... i wound up behind an ancient buddhist temple downtown and the exact point was this... https://i.redd.it/ijdbrhev4zq21.jpg"
a couple fun anecdotes,2019-04-08,"at the third attractor location i visited, i realized that i had not been collecting any artifacts and, since nothing really stood out at the location, i grabbed a cherry blossom off the ground. i then set my location with the bot and requested a new attractor. at the new location was a wooden poetry station (literally, a wooden pole with a box on top with a glass front that displays a poem; there are many of these in my city) with an a.e. housman poem about cherry blossoms. &gt;loveliest of trees, the cherry now &gt; &gt;is hung with bloom along the bough, &gt; &gt;and stands about the woodland ride &gt; &gt;wearing white for eastertide. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;now, of my threescore years and ten, &gt; &gt;twenty will not come again, &gt; &gt;and take from seventy springs a score, &gt; &gt;it only leaves me fifty more. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;and since to look at things in bloom &gt; &gt;fifty springs are little room, &gt; &gt;about the woodlands i will go &gt; &gt;to see the cherry hung with snow. i visited a couple today that, aside from being very beautiful gardens, didn't have much of note (not that i'm complaining about going around my city and seeing gardens). i was close to a coffee shop and had my laptop on me, so i decided to pop in and start a sort of formal log of points i had visited. i had visited around ten attractors at this point, so this took me about an hour. when i ordered my coffee i realized i was kinda craving something sweet and almost ordered a pastry but opted against it at the last minute. while i was there, a jazz guitarist friend of mine texted me to tell me he was going to be performing tonight and invited me to come see him. i accepted, and, after about 20 more minutes of typing up the notes i had added in my phone, i generated a new attractor and left to go check it out (i was on foot all day, i just keep my radius to 2000 meters and don't mind walking a mile or two). i got about a block away from the coffee shop and who drives by but my guitarist friend! he was also out on a ""random"" drive, delivering for postmates, and just happened to be driving by right when i left. had i stayed in the coffee shop for 30 more seconds i would have missed him. he was on his way to pick up an ice cream delivery, which was in the direction of my attractor anyway, and it seemed too serendipitous to not jump in the car with him. when he came out of the ice cream place with the delivery, he handed me a cup of ice cream and said ""they gave me this for free, you can have it,"" so i got the sweet thing i was craving afterall, hahaha &amp;#x200b; also mildly interesting to note, i went to my friend's performance tonight and the bartender was projecting john/james whitney films behind him, who produced films under the name ""uroboros films."" the symbol of the uroboros would be interesting enough, but it also just so happens that the book i'm currently reading is called [the cosmic serpent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_cosmic_serpent), so this symbol is particularly fresh and sorta at the forefront of my consciousness right now. double extra bonus, the film that was playing when i walked in was called [yantra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvwwlzsxar0). if you aren't familiar with the term, check out its [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yantra). &amp;#x200b; i tend to be pretty ""tuned in"" to synchronicities anyway, but this has been such a fun way to sort of set myself up for them to see what happens. looking forward to further exploration!"
i'm doing it! i'm so fucking depressed and miserable.,2019-04-08,"i can hardly function at times. i'm going out dude... i fell asleep early and woke up early (like 7pm-3am) and it's monday. wooo i love mondays because the week is beginning and my life is bad atm. i am now not excited and feel bad. but i felt better again just now. i think i'm rapid cycling. i have a bus pass and money. i already made a decision. i've been wanting to go on a desert adventure for many months now but my ego has been terrified. does deciding to imbue defeat the randomness?? isn't it random if all my actions are extremely random compared to years of how i have lived?? do i *need* to be aware of a probability tunnel that i do not want to change with my thoughts? in other words, does deciding where i'm traveling to and the main course defeat the purpose? my life is a loop. i'm often in my head suffering the result of am unprocessed traumatic childhood. i recently realized how much somebody i hardly ever spoke to indirectly traumatized me literally like that defining life trauma. i knew but... it was indirect. i never *held it in mind so deeply.* i became aware of the loop imo om my own over the years, i have had imo dissociative thinking since i was a young child. i had a paranormal experience of seeing my(according to half gallon of vodka/day talking to frogs drunk dd(grandma) uncle abraham lincoln in the form of a green glowing figure like that of a penny. wow....what happened? was it just a dream?... well anyways... i think i have some idea of pattern identification regarding my life. reality is insane. i have felt like the years have patterns. my facebook memories of like 10 years often shows this for the same day. i've also had some psychedelic experiences, including ketamine one single time in november. i have not been suicidal since i had that mystical, underground and flying above my apartment sims style mystical experience. i 100% believe in consciousness outside of the body and other dimensions after my single ketamine hole--perhaps two in one night. when i got up to snort more ketamine after ""falling undeground"", i shot up sims style and watched myself snort more ketamine and go lay down. i just want to live.... i feel like i need healing. ps: my apartment situation is hell, although i could fight it, but i've patterned the morphogenetic field with misery already. i would like to overcome this seemingly hellish life i've lived for so long. i blame my early childhood trauma and a lack of belonging. my belief is that of terence mckenna... nature loves courage. you make the commitment and nature will respond to that commitment by removing impossible obstacles. dream the impossible dream and the world will not grind you under, it will lift you up. this is the trick. this is what all these teachers and philosophers who really counted, who really touched the alchemical gold, this is what they understood. this is the [shamanic dance](https://psy-minds.com/shamanic-meditation-journey-within/) in the waterfall. this is how magic is done. by hurling yourself into the abyss and discovering its a feather bed."

holy shit. this is real.,2019-04-08,"there's lots of other weird stuff going on without me even going to any points anyway but i thought this was related to what some people experience so i'll share. i got an attractor right close to my house. whether or not i even try to visit it we will pass it by anyway when driving. now yesterday night this is when i got it and i almost went out in the middle of the night to get it because it was so freaking close but i changed my mind deeming it was not a good idea. so i waited till today because i assumed i'd be able to visit it without any complications. well, wrong! trying to go out today and what does the truck do? doesn't start up. thought it was a problem with the key fob not working as it's a newer model and we've had problems with its battery before, but we switched keys to no avail. had to unplug and plug it again and only then it worked after like 20 mins. just passed by the attractor but i didn't see anything spectacular besides some guy with a pink paper so there's that. it was someone elses house so i can't really investigate it any further. but what else is interesting is this very same attractor is located in the same house that we received a package from that was sent to the wrong house! it was supposed to be sent to their house but it was to ours instead. confirmed with those living with me and even though they know nothing of what i'm doing right now, it was confirmed that this same nearby attractor that got severely delayed visit also was the exact same house that didn't get it's package when we did. like what are the fucking chances??!?! after this and numerous other recent syncs i no longer believe in coincidences. the clock also apparently reset itself. starting to fail. i'm wonder what this is all about. have any other questions about my experiences? be glad to answer them."
my first trip led me to something i needed to do more trips,2019-04-09,"i generated a few attractor points this morning with the radius set as low as possible as my bike tires are flat and chose the closest ones as i had to walk and didn't want to be too late for work. i don't own a bike pump as i always used my friend's until i moved a few months ago. the attractor point turned out to be a shop that has a machine to pump up bike tires for free. nothing esoteric or interesting but will help me do more trips, so i think that's a good start."
my first randonaut outing (attractor point 5km away full of coincidences),2019-04-09,"hi there, now that i've contributed a little on the telegram chat, i thought i'd give a more detailed account of my first outing here. first timer 38f from brazil. so my first attractor point turned out to be 5km away from home, which is a lot in a metropolis like so paulo. i decided to try to go right away but the despair meme immediately kicked in and i got all these little chores i just ""had"" to take care of before setting out. lots of little foibles along the way trying to dissuade me: it was raining a fair amount (and never really stopped), i took the wrong bus and ended up at our ""japantown"" (bairro da liberdade), so i got off the bus and it took me a while to figure out where the other bus stop where i needed to be was. then the bus took its time getting there. when i was on it, i prepared myself for a pretty long journey, but it went by a lot faster than what google maps thought it would. i had never been through any of the streets along the way. anyway, i got there. turns out the specific point was in front of the monument commemorating the independence of brazil, which is at the spot where folklore claims emperor d. pedro ii proclaimed our independence from portugal, at the margins of ipiranga river (which is a load of bull, but it's part of the little colonial pseudo-grandiose narrative around our country's origins). a little interesting tidbit is that i live in an avenue called ipiranga (but in a different neighborhood as i said, 5km away). the most interesting thing about it, though, to me, was that just yesterday someone slipped a community paper of sorts (except it's a self-declared art statement/performance thing) under my apartment door elaborating on an experiment that is similar to an arg except it isn't a game per se, it's a performance. this in itself was already momentous, as i've been doing low-key research on args after watching the second season of ""the oa"". so the performance of which the paper is a part centers around this empty lot that i can see from my door. well, not physically, it is a thought/art experiment about the lot, as it is truly an interesting patch of unused land among tall buildings. one of the buildings around it is named pedro amrico, who famously depicted an artistic interpretation of the proclamation of independence (folklore preaches that there was a ""cry"" for independence at the spot that so happens to be my first attractor point). so there's a pretty intriguing link! also cool that almost no one knows that the building is named after him, because it is actually the back set of apartments of this building (it is internally divided into blocks). the blocks on the glamorous front faade of the building are named after foreign painters. the back block that can only be seen from other buildings and not from the street (i see it very clearly from my own window) is named after pedro amrico, who was brazilian, but his name isn't in a sumptuous plaque at the entrance like the others are. so i wonder if there's a connection to be made there with some subtext about a colonised country's stockholm syndrome. pedro amrico was a friggin' polymath! anyway, the little paper that i got has some poetic texts touching on the fact that the pedro amrico side of the building faces the empty plot. my apartment, in one of the 2 adjacent buildings, also has a fantastic view of the empty plot. the paper built a fictional but not entirely impossible fiction around said plot. many artists contributed, but most of them center on the space having some sort of artistic singularity. i got the paper on sunday, then today i ""randomly"" decided to finally read the thread about the fatum bot (that i had saved about 10 days ago), not being so sure about how i got to it i think it was through some other thread on the shane carruth subreddit or the the oa sub or perhaps one of the discordian/occult subs. and when i try my first attractor point, bam, it turns out to be the spot that was the subject of that most famous pedro amrico painting that the paper mentioned. i walked around the area a bit, it was almost deserted (lots of cars, actually, but hardly any pedestrians) and it had lots of derelict buildings with bits still remaining from the original architecture (some pediments and volutes and things like that), lots of homes for the elderly and lots of upper-middle class buildings too. i came across some peculiar sights (will try to link to pictures), but didn't know what exactly to pick up and take with me. i just picked up a hibiscus flower but eventually i lost it without realising it. &amp;#x200b; anyway, i decided to go back through the same bus line so i could return to bairro da liberdade and have some ramen. as i got out of the bus, what do you know, there was a ramen place. it was empty, so i should have known the despair meme would kick in. and so it did. the ramen i ordered took forever and, when it arrived, it tasted like nothing at all. i never send food back, but i just had to. it made me think i was putting dirty dishwater in my mouth. so after i finally got to a decent ramen place (which took a while, to be honest, because i kept getting lost and i took a detour into a cosmetics store), i ran out of data so couldn't use the internet and the rain picked up like crazy. despair meme up the wazoo. but the tan tan ramen was delicious and very, very spicy, which pleased me immensely. it was so comforting. i had some green tea as well, so i left there quite energised and pumped and with my mind full, synapses like fireworks. &amp;#x200b; but then i decided not to take the underground, as it was rush hour and it was raining, so i knew it would be hectic. big mistake. i waited for a long time at the wrong bus stop for a bus i wasn't sure would take me home. when it got there, i had confirmation it wouldn't take me home. so i decided to walk, it's not a long walk. the rain was steady. but alas, i managed to take a wrong turn (this is a route that i know pretty well, too) and only realised as much after a good bit. i tried to look for a taxi, there were none. i tried to gather whether any bus lines going through there would take me close to home, but i had no internet so i didn't get any reliable information on that. i couldn't call for an uber or similar (no network). so i walked into a pharmacy, got yet another toiletry item and as i got out, i decided to just go back and resume the walk. that was how i finally got back on track to return home. so my first adventure lasted for about 5 hours. i feel so good about it. if anyone's still reading, thanks! i know it won't sound as satisfying for people who aren't me, but it was a ride and although i haven't listed the entirety of it, i have a pretty big set of connections between this day and many other things going on in my life to mull over (i probably should just embody those impressions but i can't not mull). oh, then after i got home and looked at my instagram, where i had posted a picture of a piece of graffiti that was on a sidewalk near my attractor point, about 3 people left comments saying that it's a rare piece by a graffiti artist from here whose works have mostly been erased. they were really surprised. &amp;#x200b; here are the pictures: [https://photos.app.goo.gl/zezsodcvmafflrqma](https://photos.app.goo.gl/zezsodcvmafflrqma)"

"conceptually very interesting, especially with parallels to related currents...",2019-04-09,"i discovered this subreddit a week or so ago (not sure where, but i take these things in stride) and i have been reading up on the documents and accounts of this phenomenon. this isn't too far afield from certain post-modern forms of practical occultism/magic, specifically that of the chaos current. broadly, this stems from peter carroll and ray sherwin and properly started in the late 70's, although autin osman spare (early 20th century english artist, poet, and occultist) and aleister crowley (likewise, but much more on the occultist end of things) made certain inroads into this. however, it has manifested in a variety of more or less loosely affiliated ""schools,"" such as the iot, temple ov psychick youth, z-cluster, and dkmu, to name a few. the general principle is that through focused acts of will, specifically when one is \[depending on whose terminology you are using\] in a ""gnosis"" or ""open"" state, one can effect probabilistic circumstances in the universe, similar to the fatum project description of ""the butterfly effect."" the mind, at least according to peter carroll, immediately rejects what it can't reconcile, by means of a cognitive filter of sorts, so the ""art"" of magical practice is to, for lack of interest in being more precise, ""trick"" one's mind into this state. the traditions of elaborate rituals, costumes, chanting, metaphysics, symbols, roleplay, etc. endemic to magical or religious practice is merely semiotic priming of the mind to accept the reality presented. at the core is at least a basic experience of the world as probablistic, rather than strictly causal, and the term ""chaos"" in ""chaos magic"" relates more to chaos mathematics and chaos theory \[despite what naive internet edgelords may say...\]. magic is still properly crowley's ""the science and art of causing change to occur in conformity with will"", but the metaphysical underpinning is better articulated as genesis p-orridge's ""forc\[ing\] the hands of chance."" as such, at least in comparison to other forms of western occultism, chaos currents serve more a metamagical framework, rather than a strict belief system or codified set of practice. in a sense, every method of magic (even that not within the umbrella) can be analyzed by the language and tools of cm. conversely, many (if not most) practitioners co-opt bits and pieces of other magical systems, since those symbols, metaphors, rituals, etc. either speak to them or are well-tested, ready-made semiotic constructs to be experimented with and mined. fundamentally, one of the few ""core"" ideas in cm is the mutability of belief... that one can train to shift entire sets of beliefs, expectations, models, and world views for a purpose, and discard them when no longer useful to that magical operation. i would encourage those here to take a look at what is perhaps the only ""core"" or ""canon"" chaos magic book, peter carroll's _liber null_. phil hine's _condensed chaos_ (which is a more introductory treatment of much of the same material as _null_) is also good, but i think this group is already at least primed a bit. [liber null and the psychonaut](https://archive.org/details/libernullandthepsychonaut/) there are plenty of materials and groups online (not all are particularly good), so i'd suggest sticking with this to start. in general, carroll and hine produce excellent works (although they are both on the more technical end). _the psychick bible_ (jason louv's semi-recent compilation of ptv/topy materials), most anything by gordon white, grant morrison's _the invisibles_, and archtraitor bluefluke's _psychonaut field manual_ are also good materials when getting going. let me know what you think. this approach of randomized attractor-points is really quite interesting, since as a practice, it brings a lot of ""magical"" things into one's awareness."
my first locations.,2019-04-09,"the first spot i got was too far to walk before work started. my phone died before break, but i memorized the spot, and went there for lunch. i saw a telephone box wrapped in a tree. i am an electrician so, that seemed very interesting. next stop, across town to buy a phone charger. the stores near me did not sell any. odd. so i drive across town. the next point is right near my work. odd again. i work in a factory near an air ports. so i drove back across town. so the rout that my maps is suggesting is not the normal way i go to work, but i figure hey, new things. as soon as i turn off the main road church bells go off. odd again on timing. then i am immediately stopped by a funeral. wait. wait. ok onto this second point. it is in a runway. i park near it and observe. there is a semi truck parking lot near. farm fields. generally a calm area. next point i picked was a random quantum point. this app put a point on my work property right where i smoke. that was very weird. i took that as a sign to grab a cig as lunch is almost over. i can not wait to hit a couple of new spots once i get some time tonight!"
first attractor point,2019-04-09,"wanted to go for a walk, searched 1000 radius on the telegram bot. generated 3 attractor points, picked the one 5.53 it took me to the middle of a field between some commercial areas fairly close to my house. the point was almost directly on a blue post in the middle of this field. (why i didn't take a picture i don't know) but the field was filled with various garbage here and there, i didn't really feel like sifting through it fairly boring, but i did it. injected a bit of randomness into my life. at least, it was a pleasant walk. didn't feel too much dread... curious your thoughts!"
first trip. pretty deep stuff.,2019-04-09,"okay, so a little bit of a backstory is necessary in order for this to make sense: about ten years ago there was this guy in our friend circle, let's call him joe. joe and me were kind of close friends throughout middle school and we drifted apart towards the beginning of high school for a couple years, but then ended up reuniting through mutual friends right after graduation. i was a huge dickbag to joe for those few months for no real reason. long story short he had enough of my shit and we ended up getting into this pretty gnarly fistfight that left us arch enemies for the better part of a decade after that. fast forward to the end of 2018 and we made amends at a local bar and have been super close ever since. now for the weird randonaut trip i took a couple hours ago on my lunch break at work. i installed telegram and added shangrila_bot and all that jazz. did the command for an attractor point and it gave me an address to a home in this little neighborhood i haven't so much as driven through since i graduated highschool in 2009. thought it was a little strange that it gave me a home address but i figured i would drive by and see if anything stood out to me. first strange thing that happened: i'm waiting to turn left at a red light and this guy in a beat up old ford truck turns across the road from the street perpendicular to me and the whole time he's not even looking at where he's going - he is looking at me, shrugging and laughing hysterically while shaking his head. i thought something might have been wrong with my car or maybe he just thought i looked stupid or something, idk. i didn't think much of it after that. just continued on my trip. i didn't pay attention to the route or street names or anything on my gps aside from the destination; i wanted it to be as random and unpredictable as possible for me. so i'm getting closer and closer to the house; 1000ft away, 350ft away and finally i'm there. i look over and the attractor point was the house at which joe and his parents lived when we were in school. i'm not sure that there's any real significance behind it other than the fact that it has done a llllot in further confirming this simulation theory stuff for me. i'm still kind of shocked by how it turned out and i'm definitely going to be exploring the random a lot more from now on. crazy stuff."
attractor power,2019-04-09,"i got an attractor with power 5.79. does this mean that the attractor is generated correctly, or do higher numbers signify an attractor anomaly? the bot explanation of attractor power is confusing me. in theory, if it is less than two, then it is difficult to call it an anomaly."

attractor point i have already been to,2019-04-09,i live in the country where im surrounded by fields and a few years ago i used to go on walks through the fields. i once walked to a river and woods in the field about a half mile away from my house. i generated an attractor point that happened to be in the exact place that i went to. i didnt see that many weird things except a deer that looked like it had been attacked by a coyote. i just might visit the point again.
first journey,2019-04-09,"trying to report as we go. will go back through and edit after. convinced my girlfriend to try this out with me, not sure if she fully comprehends what we are about to do, but i thought itd be interesting to do this as a duo since i havent read of anybody trying it this way. i was going to try this last night but as soon as i started to prepare and generate a location i got sick to my stomach (i never get sick, so this was odd) driving to a newly generated location now. its only a mile or so away. on route, ellen(gf) said i feel like we are doing something wrong. im very anxious first location- behind a big strip center. big no trespassing sign. i wanted to walk past the sign to the exact point but gf was trippin out. there was someone in the back of a honda accord trying not to be seen. really weird. i didnt see them at first... but she was sure she did. after i stared for a while, i saw them peek up. it was very odd. i still wanted to explore, but ellen convinced me otherwise. so i set that attractor as current location on telegram and generated a new point. [location 1](https://imgur.com/gallery/q9bmcf9) on route to location 2 my check engine light came on. quickly logged the code and saw it was for a post cat o2 sensor. this is extremely weird because i coded the downstream wideband out of my car when i tuned it after removing the catalytic converter. (im a big automotive enthusiast) location 2- nothing remarkable. the point was directly between two houses in a neighborhood. [location 2](https://imgur.com/gallery/8zidf7o) decided to generate one more, the same way as last time. location 3- the point is behind a big fence, there was no way in. people watching us probably wondering what the hell we are doing, lol. i picked a flower here and im going to pot it when home. [flower](https://imgur.com/gallery/ext1fwo) when we got home, ellen got an email about a job interview. she said you said we may be changing the order of things. when you said that, i thought about what if i finally get s response to one of my applications ive tried to tell her about manifestation via positivity. she may be catching on. definitely doing this again. i may still go back to where the first point was later. i feel like i should go. what do yall think?"
reality shifting - how soon ?,2019-04-09,"hello everyone, &amp;#x200b; i've just sub-ed , and find this subject matter very intriguing indeed. &amp;#x200b; to those ""experienced"" experimenters, &amp;#x200b; 1. how soon did your reality change, for the better/or worse ? 2. how many trips/locations until you felt a tangible shift in your reality ? 3. are 3 locations the bare minimum to experience a shift ? 4. do you consistently visualize your intent whilst travelling and exploring the given locations, or just before setting out then forgetting about it ? &amp;#x200b; many thanks."
second attractor point (power: 4.32),2019-04-10,"i got an attractor point that was 4:32 but it was about a mile into the field behind my house. i found a friend who wanted to go with me and we spent about 20 minutes walking there. on our way there we saw random holes and pieces of metal. when we were about .4 miles away we even found a large refrigerator in a woods near the field. once we finally found the point, there was this huge abandoned silo with some [drawings](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/eyne4td) that resembled a wolf. i also just felt so calm there it was amazing i really hope i can find some new points soon."
first trip summary,2019-04-10,"attractor - 3.75 (i posted this in the telegraph thread, so it may sound familiar) i went on my first expedition. three of my attractor sites were in the same park, so i went to the first of them today, which i chose because the google maps arrow was directly above a small building, which i found intriguing. it turned out to be a chemical shed, next to a public pool that is currently closed. three egg shells were beside the building, like some kids had egged it, along with assorted trash and debris. i took a piece of orange plastic from the site, which matched an orange bead i found on the ground not long ago and put in my car (the bead was not related, aside from the fact that i passed it while walking, doubled back and felt like i ""should"" take it with me). from meditation practice i've seen how ""reacting"" to small synchronicities can trigger larger ones, so i'll be curious to see if that happens."

losing my sanity,2019-04-10,"posting on throwaway. i am living out of my car right now. first attractor brought me to a port a potty in a really nice neighborhood. very out of place. i really had to pee so i was grateful. second attractor, i wish to have a place to live. its a man moving things into his uhaul. i get out and ask him if he knows anyone renting a room. he says he just moved out of his place and its open for $1050 (a little out of my price range, but i considered taking the room on the spot.) i didnt. third attractor. im on the phone with my friend. she gets up to get something to eat. all i find is a nickel on the ground. 1997. its the year she was born, i thought. i confirmed it with my friend when she got back. yes, she was born that year. i set my radius to 1997 and searched again. now this last particular point holds a lot of value to me. i once a few years back, before the mandela effect, took something from a church i shouldnt have. i had a lot of hate for religion at the time. i have since tried to repay my karma. anyways... fourth attractor. its nighttime by now and pouring rain. google maps didnt show it as anything... but im on this huge campus. im the only goddamn car there. im a woman in my mid 20s. naturally i start getting a little freaked out. i look it up... marylhurst university. defunct since 2018. now owned by sisters of mother mary or something... christian. i dont know. anyway. i muster up the courage to go out my car. i wish i had a video because this was really some shit, i swear to god, i have tears coming down my face. i make my way across this field, and the marker is right behind this church. there are 2 cars parked out back - i had seen only one other car parked on the far other end of the complex. my marker is right on top of a golf cart. yes a goddamn golf cart, with the university logo on it. all the other university logos were nowhere to be seen until now. i swear on everything and all that exists. i called my friend again and told her what was going on. she got excited and told me to see if the cart had the keys in it... (she obviously wasnt grasping the severity of the situation) i told her i wasnt gonna steal anything. but i was eyeballing the golf cart. i sat down on it with the intent of at least taking it for a joyride. and instantly. out of nowhere, a man popped out the front door of the church. it was like christ himself was popping out. i swear. he gives me a look that says everything he needed to ask me. i said, ""listen sir, im sorry, if you want to know the truth, im homeless right now and im just here talking to my friend on the phone, ill get out of here."" he said and i quote - ""i just dont want anyone stealing my golf cart"". thank god my friend was on the phone and heard ths interaction because im not sure anyone would have believed me otherwise. i decided that was too much. but i put in a few more attractors. all trying to bring me back to the university... in a fairly big radius. then one that tried to put me in the river behind it. i am scared. i have been thinking about things for a long time. this is not real. this is absolutely the icing on the cake for me. if they delete my post, be warned about using this."

fatum bot down?,2019-04-10,is it possible the bot is down sometimes? get no messages even arter restart
on the 'despair-meme'..,2019-04-10,"there seems to be this notion that the anxiety caused by the despair-meme may be otherworldly in nature coming from a subconscious awareness that one is hacking the simulation .. but who's to say that it's not just the natural anxiety that comes from being aware you may be tresspassing or going somewhere dangerous when following an attractor point to its origin? it seems to me that the 'despair-meme' is really nothing extraordinary, and not something implanted in people from an extradimensional or otherworldly place."
suspicion,2019-04-10,"how do we know this isn't malific? like collecting info on ""target persons,"" etc.? i understand the despair meme thing but couldn't it just as easily be a way to get us to ignore our inner trepidation towards participating? also, i read that one of the founders (and i mean no disrespect at all to this person) ended his life? i just feel there are a lot of red flags with this experiment. thoughts?"

two times,2019-04-10,i went out hunting spots. the first couple times were in back of ppls houses. i got to some public type area. first attractor was a twisted up tree. second one couldn't get right ontop of it. was swampy downed trees. but a fee meters away was a padlocked rectangular thing in the ground. it was unlocked and rusty. i'm guessing a gas vent.

my attractor story so far,2019-04-11,"throwaway cause frankly this bot is making me question reality and i don't want people to think i am insane. two days ago my housemate told me about this sub after spotting it on trending. kinda dismissed it at first, sounded pretty creepypasta. i downloaded telegram and generated my first attractor out of curiosity. i was surprised to see that it put me on a road nearby called brookside, which is the nickname i have called my housemate since we were in school together. funny coincidence. i generated another attractor point, it selected a road which was named after a nickname my housemate uses for me. that felt like a pretty extreme coincidence but it was late, so i didn't visit the position. last night i went for a walk with my housemate and another friend. we decided to visit an attractor point nearby. it was in a large building site. at first we thought there would be no way in and almost gave up, i pushed the idea and we were surprised to find the site entrance gate wide open, it really should have been locked. we made our way towards the attractor point, quite nonchalantly and joking around. it was just inside of a house that was under construction. i looked around and couldn't see anything interesting. i double checked my phone and realised that my gps had drifted a bit, i wasn't quite on top of the attractor. one of my friends says 'maybe its through that doorway, the one that wasn't there before'. he was joking around but truly, none of us had previously noticed this door right in front of our eyes. it was right on top of the attractor. i walked through it, my housemate just behind me. suddenly an extremely bright strobe light starts going off and scares the shit out of us all, we got out of there. as we walked away i saw that the side of the house was being illuminated by this bright white strobe. &amp;#x200b; we figured it was a site alarm of some kind but it made no sound and again, what a coincidence. we have spent plenty of time wandering around these building sites over the last couple years (big local construction project) and we have never come across a site alarm of any kind before. when we got back to the house, admittedly freaked out after having such a by-the-book experience on our first try, my housemate decided to get another attractor. it suggested we go back to damn near the exact same spot. we decided against it. tl;dr - skeptical person, first two attractors on roads that shared names with mine &amp; my housemates nicknames. visited first attractor with two friends last night, experienced a strong warning. friend then generated an attractor point in the same spot when we got home. &amp;#x200b; question - once an attractor has been generated, do you need to visit it quickly or will it always be valid?"

"distinguishing between ""despair meme"" and rational thinking/my first location in retrospect",2019-04-11,"i visited my first location the other day and was pretty underwhelmed. i generated a point that ended up being a house about 3 blocks from me on a residential dead end. i went down the street and noticed the pin that appeared to be at the second to last house on the right on my pc was actually at the last house, but right on the border of the two houses. my visit was going to be brief anyway, mostly a drive by seeing as it was a residential area, but it ended up being cut even shorter. as i rolled up on the place there was a guy in an suv backed into the far side of the driveway and just sitting in his car. he was making no effort to get out and looked like he was waiting for someone or something, possibly even slightly nervously (my gut said maybe drugs). he seemed to be paying attention to me but with a slightly forced casualness. i turned around in the driveway across the street and left. my initial thoughts were that even though the point was in that driveway the woods at the end of the street were the most interesting part. i knew they existed but not that they butted up to that road and i've never been in them. other than that i thought how ironic it was my first and only outing and there was a dude in the driveway of my location that ruined me taking my time. after reading some more of these accounts of location visits and realizing the general thought process you all approach them with i've revised my thoughts. it made me realize that the guy in the car was actually parked right where the location indicated, had i had time or the nerve to get under it there's no way some part of this car wouldn't have been it. looking back i suppose i could have asked the guy for directions just to get closer to the point but it didn't occur to me at the time. his presence was actually more of a deterrent- despair meme at work? i live in a suburban area and the few tests i've done with the bot always generates a house address. between that and feeling like my first try was pointless i pretty much put this on the back burner. now that i've reexamined my first location though i think i'm going to give it another shot and try to approach it with this newfound viewpoint. how are you guys handling locations that are houses or have people in that spot?"

first rando-outing,2019-04-11,"went for my first rando outing today... some odd things, but also i am still getting the hang of using the bot. &amp;#x200b; first point, using quantum was not too far from my house but was inaccessible as it was on the train tracks. 10 years ago i would have chanced it but there was a security camera overhead and i'm a little old to get busted for trespassing. i kept seeing the number 15 (three times) so i don't know if that is significant. &amp;#x200b; what was weird though is that i was listening to fip radio (for those that don't know it, it's awesome) as i often do and as happens often for me the song was synched to what was happening... right as i arrived at the train tracks a song talking about the train tracks came on. then a lyric to the effect of ""can't you hear it coming"" and immediately a helicopter overhead. &amp;#x200b; messed around with the bot and got a few points but they were way to far, then i changed the radius to 1500 (adding the 15 i kept seeing) and it took me to another inaccessible place- an old hospital complex in town that they are converting into a library. but what was odd about this is that it was behind an area that i had already accessed by mistake one day on a random walk. i was really blunted and had been seeing all these like, ancient egypt symbols at that time and i just kind of wandered into the construction site and saw this giant dirt pyramid. i'm not going to go all into the significance of that because its some personal spiritual stuff but i digress. i didn't try to access it going the way that i went before because it's blocked off, and again, i'm not going to risk trespassing. (especially since i am in a foreign country on expired visa). i went home after that. &amp;#x200b; in summary, both points inaccessible, one being a place that had some spiritual meaning for me, and seeing the number 15 repeated. &amp;#x200b; i am going to make a point of doing this like every day since i am out of work and also trying to exercise more so, we'll see what comes!"

trees: friend... or foe?,2019-04-11,"attractor point led me to a nearby park that i visit often. didn't notice anything of note, so i decided i'd just chill there and sorta bask in the environment for a while. sat at the base of the tree closest to the coordinates i got and just closed my eyes and spaced out for a while, listening to the breeze, birds, etc. felt the texture of the bark and moss on the tree and tried to imagine the enormous network of roots underneath me, quietly sucking up nutrients and chilling with worms and spent some time considering how much that tree has lived through and seen and how it will still be doing tree shit long after i'm gone (hopefully) and it ended up just being a nice 20-30 minute pseudo-meditation before i stood up and generated a new attractor. the next attractor point led me to an enormous slavic baptist church, it was pretty calm and quiet there, and i was standing there looking for signs and there was suddenly an enormous racket above my head, a loud crunching and scraping. i was super disoriented and didn't understand what was going on and looked up and a large branch was falling out of the tree i was standing under, but it simply got caught in lower branches, showering me in twigs, leaves, bark and other debris. it seemed so surreal as to be dreamlike, and i stepped aside to let my heart rate return to normal and took my phone out, ready to film if the branch continued to fall, but it looked pretty secure in its new location a few branches down from where it started. it wasn't huge, like, it wouldn't have killed me, but it was large and definitely would have really sucked/hurt if it had landed on me. maybe this tree was jealous of how much attention i gave the previous tree. maybe it just wanted to be heard or make a point. or maybe trees just don't give a fuck. either way, this was the craziest, most direct, uhh ""incident"" that happened since i started participating in this project and felt it was worth sharing. be safe, and respect trees!"

our attractor point led us to a place my mom dreamed about last night,2019-04-12,"so, we did our very first attractor points tonight. the first one led us to the side of a road that was pretty dull and uninteresting. the only thing we really found was an opened granola bar wrapper. so we decided to try again. &amp;#x200b; our second point was much more interesting. we drove through taco bell to grab something to snack on and i managed to generate a point that was literally less than a minute away. we made our way over there down a sideroad none of us had ever really noticed before. the point was in a parking lot of a dark building. we got out of the car and started following it around and the point was dead-center in a pothole. it was certainly interesting but nothing out of the ordinary. &amp;#x200b; so, what was interesting was the fact that we had parked directly across from a **best western plus regency** that none of us knew existed in our small town. it was massive and had a ton of activity, at 11'o'clock at night. cars constantly pulling in and out, super fast. there was a security guard walking around their parking lot, too, checking cars with a flashlight, walking a german shepherd. he looked directly at our car so my mom shouted at us to get in the car so we could leave, which you can hear in the end of \[this video\]([https://vimeo.com/329954029](https://vimeo.com/329954029)). &amp;#x200b; so, we got the heck outta there, then headed home. mid-way home, my mom gasps and says she remembered something. **last night, she had a dream - she was at a best western** with her sister and brother-in-law, who is dead. there was a massive buffet with bowls of fruit all over the tables. **so, she had a dream at a best western, then we ended up at a point directly across from a best western we didn't even know existed.** &amp;#x200b; kinda creepy, yeah?"

in retrospect...,2019-04-12,"just a thought after digesting my first two outings. i would 1. take a friend. call it a wingman, wingwoman, wingperson, battle buddy, whatever. (i personally identify as a ham sandwich) i live in very rugged territory and it's inherently dangerous anyway. but my secondary stomping grounds are very urban and has it's own dangers. 2. bring a flashlight, a snack, maybe a garbage bag, day pack...etc. 3. let someone known where you are going. seriously, watch some missing 411 episodes on youtube. i can't emphasize this enough. make sure someone has an idea where you are going. send the coordinates to a friend, whatever, so if something happens you don't have to wait two weeks for help and end up having to eat your battle buddy (or ham sandwich). 4. bring a lighter. trying to start any type of fire is rediculously harder than you might expect and you never know if you might need it. 5. bring a towel."

4 black crows around a short stubby palm tree,2019-04-12,"so i got an attractor point that was a 3 minute walk from my bedroom at like a 9.3 and i know thats supposed to be very anomalous adventure. i took the walk and on my way to the point which was in front of a neighbors house, i saw 4 black crows with a little bit of food in their mouth, all fly over the white fence behind the short stubby palm tree. one at a time, it was almost like a synchronized crow dance. it was really beautiful, and they all moved the same way. it was like i saw what happened t the first one exactly the same way three more times. it was pretty anomalous to me, thats why im writing it up. i loved it. felt like a little gift to watch."
first outing (long post),2019-04-12,"set up the bot last night and generated a few attractor points. i was sorta messing around at first, dipping my toes if you will. managed to generate one this morning at 6.64, seemed to grab my attention the most (aside from generating a point at 1.11 at 11.10am. synchronicity?) i normally go for walks in the countryside near my place and this was somewhere i had been before (years back) so i thought what the hell. a couple more attractors were generated in a field near it so i thought i'd do a loop. first point was backing some houses, i could see it was a half fallen tree from the path but i just didn't approach it. not sure why, just felt apprehensive and didn't want to. only thing of note was a small black cat hiding in the grass a little before it. cat looked cute and i didn't want to disturb it so i moved onto the next point. another old, withered tree. again, nothing of note really except i discovered that the path that ran past it led to the main road.(interestingly i had walked that main road and looked down the driveway and wondered where it lead. question answered: it lead to where i stood. neat.) only thing that really stood out to me was that as i walked past the first attractor point to the second (through a gap in the hedge) i turned to see a dog walker staring at me from where i'd come from. made me feel a bit uneasy but i'll put it down to the fact i didn't have a dog and was sorta wandering off the normal path. anyway, i walked from the second point to the third, a place i had been before when i was younger. as i skirted the edge of the field leading me back to this track that lead to the third attractor, i think i became hyper aware of noise and rustling in the hedges around me. no biggie, i rationalise to myself. middle of the afternoon and there are birds. okay. walked past the dog walker again who had stopped to chat to someone (upon walking past i realised it was an old neighbour of mine!) and i could feel them watching me as i approached the third point; by this time i'm feeling a little on edge and shaky and not sure what to expect. i arrive at the third point and it was strange.. not because of anything happening or strange objects but because when i had been there in my younger years, i remember sitting at the base of the tree. but today, i stood and stared at three trees. now this is the point with 6.64 as a reading. i felt a bit strange and didn't stay very long and the only things i picked up there were two leaves. i picked up a red leaf on my way back as well as it really stood out to my eyes and this was on the path that i walked most evenings (i walk up there to clear my head and watch the sunset). the only other thing of note was generating attractors whilst at a coffee shop a couple hours later and i had three consecutive points generate on the same road the other side of town. i haven't gone to this road as of yet and i'm wondering if the attractors/repellers have a time limit? i plan to go there later tonight but i'm unsure if it'll be too late. i'm not really sure what to make of this. it's incredibly fascinating stuff but i wonder if due to subconscious skepticism i was unable to make the most of my trips. i was prepared of sorts, had a phone to take photos and a pen and notepad to jot down notes. did i do anything wrong?"

(we called it the stasis field) so you can even find yourself in places where the usual randomizer would never lead you because of its dependence on the launch time and mathematical operations. we managed to find two available sources of quantum randomness: one of them (qrng) is an open server https://qrng.anu.edu.au/ which receives random numbers by measuring the magnetic field fluctuations of virtual particles in a vacuum. the second (reg) is a reg-1 psyleron hardware module purchased from the internet using tunnel effects in a field-effect transistor. fatum software supports both sources. 4. stasis field stasis field is the entire set of causal relationships that limits the variability of potential outcomes. at the application level, this is the power that holds us in our reality-tunnel, making your life predictable to a certain extent. when disturbed, the stasis field tends to converge. that is, it will prevent you from exiting the probability-tunnel. in addition to the obvious physical limitations, the memetic factors of the stasis field will create the greatest convergence. these may include any boundaries of consciousness that predetermine your behavior: studied methodologies, prejudice attitudes, the habit of noticing things only on certain grounds, etc. the greatest memetic danger is the despair-meme, which becomes one of the most powerful levers of pressure from the stasis field. during the first experiment, when 70,000 randomly selected people were sent to random points coordinates, almost all of them immediately decided that the points were sent with the aim of a scam and saw danger in them. as a result, a very few decided to go there. such a reaction can be explained by the activation of the despair-meme, with which the holistic memeplex tries to keep you within the framework of the pattern. the principle of despair-meme is simple, it is transmitted in the form of signals that simultaneously carry a danger and the impossibility of resisting it. for example: an endless stream of bad and terrifying news in public media, aggression from people in a higher position in the social hierarchy, nagging people who cause discomfort at the level of empathy, but not taking advice to solve problems, etc. since the resulting stress is unsolvable, a closed cycle of self-reflection is created, producing stress and a feeling of helplessness, prompting a person to search for an accessible target for their sublimation and send the same signal to someone else. when the external signal ceases to function, the consciousness continues to paranoidly seek out any signs of a similar danger and inventing threats where there are none. so the meme of helplessness auto-stimulates itself. thus, any new and unusual information will be perceived with suspicion. increased exposure to despair-meme can also lead to apathy and paranoia. and this is just one of the well-known memetic hazards that the explorer of reality-tunnels should fear. filter-bubbles and their habits to notice only useful things in your everyday life will also significantly reduce your chances of getting out of the pattern. 5. void-meme the main memetic component of the fatum system is the void-meme. void-memes are the open questions. in our case, this is the great unknown laying outside the deterministic world. being completely indefinite, it, like the rorschach stains, draws the most daring assumptions from your imagination, trying to fill the void of uncertainty. this creates a release of dopamine and motivates you, and since energy is expended in the search for truth, the mind seeks confirmation of its expectations and pays attention to anything even slightly unusual. in this way, the ability to notice anomalies is greatly increased, and any anomalies that are noticed form new attention filters, which, due to the baader-meinhof effect, make it possible to notice new types of things. this changes your very vision of the surrounding world, thus completing the creation of a new reality-tunnel. you are involved in a new system of causal relations not only at the causal, but also at the memetic level, you begin not only to find yourself in new places, but also to act differently. it is necessary to take into account the effect of ""talking walls"", which has been repeatedly observed by participants in the experiment. it lies in the fact that, arriving at the point of fatum, the researcher begins to notice that the writings on the walls have interconnected content, similar to an attempt to communicate with him. the effect can be associated with a void-meme, as a result of an attempt of mind to confirm it's expectations of the supernatural, but often the coincidence of the writings were so improbable that we cannot be sure of this. 6. genesis field the most interesting part of our experiment was the hypothesis about the possibility of the impact of the noosphere on the quantum probability put forward by the pear laboratory in princeton. (http://noosphere.princeton.edu/papers/pear/fieldreg2.pdf) it says that if a researcher thinks hard about a certain outcome, the probability of quantum measurements deviates slightly from the average expected one. scientists have also shown that a general cognitive background, for example, during significant historical events, has an impact on quantum rngs around the world. to explore the possibilities of this theory, we have created an additional algorithm for calculating the ""attractor-points"". to do this, several thousand random points are generated on the map, and then the places are searched around which these points gather in dense clusters, deviating from a uniform distribution. it is assumed that probability-anomalies can appear in these places, or being there can trigger a cascade of events leading to a significant consequence. many researchers also noted that at such points they found images and objects that they thought about before the start of the experiment. the effect of the interaction of thoughts with quantum fluctuations was called by us the genesis field. it has the same nature as the stasis field, but of a higher dimension. if such distortions can be similar to the asher peres paradox (the possibility of the future to influence the past through the quantum entanglement), then it is likely that any interaction with the attractor-points can lead the researcher to certain versions of the future that he is thinking about. in contrast to the attractor-points we developed void-attractor-points. they calculate in the same way, but instead of the densest clusters of points, an area is searched for where they avoid falling. big places where there are no random points at all. such places may be blind spots of the genesis field. 7. planeshifting although the creation of new reality-tunnels is of a purely causal-perceptual nature (you do not literally enter another world, you just have the opportunity to see and interact with new parts of it), there is also a hypothesis that an experiment may cause cases of the so-called dimension jumping. dimension jumping is a quantum teleportation into a parallel reality, which differs from your own in some small way. often associated with the phenomena such as the mandela-effect. since most dimension jumping methods on the internet suggest an enhanced mental adjustment to the desired version of reality, it can be assumed that if this phenomenon is real, then it is associated with the genesis field. in that case, fluctuations in quantum probability will be caused precisely by moving to parallel reality along the probability axis. then the use of attractor-points related to these fluctuations can be a real creation of a portal to a parallel world. then the fatum project is not just a way to create new probability-tunnels, but a way to travel through the multiverse. many researchers have reported about changes in various details in their environment. in some cases, new buildings appeared, unusual types of merry-go-rounds on children's playgrounds, which the researcher had not seen before, but according to official data, they have existed there for several years. we called this method planeshifting. it is recommended to avoid the effects of despair-memes during the planeshifting, as they can cause negative expectations and move you to dangerous timelines. it was also observed that when trying to build chains of three or more successively visited points of an attractor, a lot of causal obstacles arise, such as vehicle breakdowns, loss of communication, the emergence of urgent matters distracting from the experiment. it is recommended to save all unusual items found at points of the attractor and entangle them to your everyday life. their very existence in your reality-tunnel can help synchronize with the new timeline. objects may have unusual causal properties btw. * desktop version"

first time outing experience,2019-04-14,"went to two points today with my partner . he did one and i did one. he generated the point and two seconds before the point was sent to him, he gets a text from his buddy whom we were meeting later on, telling him come over early as he got out of work early . we go to the two points before we head over to buddy's house . nothing interesting or strange to be seen honestly. but when we got to buddy's place it got interesting . we hung out a couple hours chatting and playing board games when all of a sudden buddy's gf starts talking about the matrix. she then proceeds to tell me that i would be happier not knowing about the matrix and that knowing i'm in an alternative reality or world would be difficult and depressing . i was kind of in shock honestly . we had not told them anything about our little excursion or brought up anything about this group or anything related to it . i tried to inquire further as to why she was telling me this but the conversation ended as soon as it started and she moved on to another topic . interesting turn of events. i kind of feel like something was telling me to quit."
the simulation is held up by rules,2019-04-14,"in seeing others mention such wild evidence i had a question. what if the simulation is held up by rules and what we are doing breaks them? it makes sense that us ""glitching"" through the project is really us breaking a rule. if more of us break them the simulation crumbles."

field notes,2019-04-14,"journeyed with a partner. partner generated a 7.4 power attractor point. oddly, it led us to a location that my partner had already been to as a teen (ten years ago). the location was once a rural field where kids would hang out to drink alcohol. now it is a residential neighborhood. the attractor point was strangely still an empty lot.... i walked around the lot, but could find no artifacts. perceived anomalies: 1. street name was very similar to my partners first name, the letters were out of order (eg -if her name was elizabeth - street name was elsabet) 2. location was an empty plot, just mud and grass. sidewalk strangely ended and began again in front of lot. from that location i generated a 6.4 powered attractor. this led us 3 miles north to an even more rural location. the location was in the middle of a gated field where several large bulls were grazing. i did not get out of the vehicle to explore. perceived anomalies: 1. on the road, a vehicle had stalled immediately in front of us. we passed the vehicle, and observed the driver in some sort of frozen state. he did not look at us as we passed. 2. as we parked at the attractor site we noticed two white alpacas (?!) in a pen on the opposite side of the road. when we left, we passed by the pen but the animals were no longer there. i did manage a photo of the animals. 3. returning back the way that we had came, we decided to check on the stalled vehicle. the vehicle was still on the road, but located about 200 meters backwards from where we had first seen it. there was now a second vehicle behind it, and the drivers of both vehicles were both standing like statues on the side of the road. we decided not to stop. definitely a strange trip. we will be taking more in the future"
first trip was creepy and possibly a bad omen.,2019-04-14,"welp, that was depressing, first i went to the wrong place because i got confused when giving the bot my location, saw a nearby point on a map and thought the bot generated it, went there, nothing much happened, then realized that the point was actually just a very bad representation of my supposed location that my phone was trying to give the bot. the location was actually what my phone thought was my location, the bot had not generated it. did not have time to do any more so nixed trying the actual bot locations that day. i might add that while going here, i fully believed it was legit, did not realize it was a mistake location until later, but felt no foreboding on the way. but since it did not come from the bot, i do not consider that my first real trip. next try, this time i correctly generated a rando location to go to after work on a friday, looked on map, it was a cemetery in a nearby area i had never visited, did not even know it was there. now i am not spooked by cemeteries, i even used to rent an apartment across from one and i enjoyed the quiet neighbors, still thought it was a bit weird though. drove there but the gates were already closed for the day. tried the cemetery again today (sunday) after verifying it was open. i tried to call and my phone froze completely which it has never done, could not even get the power button to work, but i found hours on the website with my laptop. went there, and this time i did feel a sense of foreboding on the way, but hey it is a cemetery so who knows, parked, and walked towards the specific point the bot generated. there were tons of fresh flowers around, seems most plots were full of people who died around the 80s to recently, but absolutely zero people walking around in the entire place other than way down by the main building near the road so i was totally by myself. creepily, the bot spot turned out to be way in the back of the cemetery and was the exact start of a line assumedly empty cement grave liners: https://imgur.com/a/bvqslfo some had wires on them i assume so a machine can grab and lift them when they are needed. i was kinda creeped out, decided to walk along them and then go visit a lake region that had many lines of housings for cremated ashes containers, most of the plaques were still blank. felt a great sadness at that time, kept thinking about people i knew who had died in the past or might die in the future. eventually walked back towards the car. i saw another car had illegally parked behind me at a weird angle even though there were tons of open parking all over, then a very old hippy looking women comes rushing out of the building, looks right at me and says, ""sorry but i had to go, i couldn't help it. i couldn't help it, i had to go."" i assumed she had to go the bathroom, but word choice was creepy. then she laughed and said she was talking to her husband still in the car but she could be talking to me too. i saw then that a man was still in the car. i said, ""oh it's ok, it's fine!"" she smiled, got in their car and they drove off and i did same, still feeling kinda sad aftereffects from the trip though. :-("
my first week as an urban randonaut,2019-04-15,"**method:** wrote down one location for every option (/getpseudo, /getquantum, /getattractor, /getrepeller, /getpair) and over the course of one week explored every one on foot. &amp;#x200b; **tldr**: discovered a bike path i didnt know existed, walked through a park i pass by all the time but had never set foot in, came upon a jamaican ice cream parlor, found a child-sized corvette, found a loonie bin (i take this as a joke and not despair meme) a house full of stacks of books and a landrover with a sticker that said life is an adventure. 04/07/19 radius: 3000 /getpseudo my first pinpoint took me to an address in an industrial area next to a set of criss-crossing traintracks. a short, dead-end street i had never heard of nor visited. saw what im guessing was a metal works shop and an autobody shop. then, just south of the buildings i noticed a parking lot with a rack of those ride share pay-per-use bicycles. i thought it was an odd location for bike rentals but when i walked closer i discovered a beautiful bike bath leading through some trees! i made a mental note to return at a later date and explore the length of the path. 04/07/19 radius: 3000 /getquantum my second pinpoint led me to a row of townhouses along a highway across the street from a huge park/community centre. ive been past this park dozens of times, yet never set a single foot inside. so of course i took advantage of the opportunity! so far im pretty impressed with the locations that shangri-la has dug up for me. 04/10/19 radius: 3000 /getrepeller this location was on a major street in my neighborhood, yet farther north than i tend to frequent. in that way it was both familiar and unfamiliar. i had been craving chocolate mini-eggs and as i left the house thought to myself i hope my travels take me past something sweet,. as i neared my checkpoint, a sign on the sidewalk grabbed my attention, forcing me to a stop. it was a school for shotokan karate...this is meaningful to me as this was the exact style of karate i took as a child and i was considering taking it up again, but last i checked there werent any shotokan dojos in my area. a few moments later i came to my destination, and laughed - the address i was seeking belongs to none other than a jamaican ice cream parlor! something sweet indeed :) 04/10/19 radius: 3000 /get pair (repeller) this destination is actually only about five minutes away from the ice cream shop and according to the map, is the site of a catholic school. as i crossed the street and came around the bend, i noticed a restaurant sign for a vegetarian restaurant set to open soon this also means something to me as ive been saying to myself this neighborhood needs a decent vegetarian restaurant, why cant someone open one up? the school sits on a quiet street ive never heard of. no children, parents or teachers were around as it was nearly 8pm. the residents across the street had their garbage bins out as pickup was scheduled for the following morning. anything too large or awkward to fit in a bin gets placed next to it on the curb. someone from this family had put out one of those miniature cars that three year olds drive, and i laughed, thinking about the randonaut who found the abandoned moped (have fatum bot, will travel!) unsure of what to do with a tiny car my ass is to big to fit in, i decided to leave my artifact where it was and snapped a photograph instead. &amp;#x200b; *processing img 2iju751i2cs21...* a few doors down from the car i saw a large blue metal junk receptacle (the ones people use when renovating or doing extensive yardwork) that read loonie bins in big bold letters on the front. at least the designer of the simulation has a sense of humor ;) &amp;#x200b; *processing img 8jfaf1ro2cs21...* 04/11/2019 radius: 3000 /get attractor (3.11) had some trouble getting to this location due to construction, but i stubbornly persisted before any despair-meme could take hold. i found myself in a wealthy upscale neighborhood. the houses on the street were all dimly lit, though no one seemed to be home. i could see right through the windows as no one had their curtains drawn. the pinpoint address had row upon row of tall vertical stacks of books piled up on a table by the window. none of the spines were facing me so i couldnt read any of the titles. i found myself wondering if some kind of wacky author or professor lives there. 04/14/2019 radius: 3000 /get pair - (get attractor 3.29) rain continuously today and i was so grateful that it lifted for an hour when i decided to step out for my quantum walk. the residence itself wasnt all that interesting but the location kind of was at the very beginning (or end depending on how you want to look at it) of a street that i thought i knew reasonably well. i realized that i had only ever traveled the same section and assumed it ended perpendicularly at the major road when in fact, it goes north again for a block until bumping up against the train tracks and transit yards. as i looped around the parking lot adjacent to the property a large yellow landrover grabbed my attention. on the side there was a sticker that read life is an adventure :)"

down the rabbit hole we go..,2019-04-15,"sort of fell into this sub earlier today, and it clicked so hard for me. i've been thinking a lot about simulation theory recently, about ways to hack the simulation, cheat codes, glitches. have generated a few locations today including a really interesting pair, the attractor being a park next to my flat, where i used to work (in the cafe) and the closest bit of semi 'forest' i can get to. the void being a children's play area next to where i lived as a teenager, in the worst mental health of my life. there are no trees there. it was from there i first fled my home town at 18. went to the attractor today and it was clear the message was ""get back to the forest"". i felt amazingly peaceful. the forest bit of the park is tiny and the spot was in the middle of it. for context, i've been struggling with feeling suffocated in my home town. i've always travelled and roamed freely before. now i have a nice place and stable job but it feels wrong. seen a job in the most gorgeous part of the country right next to a big forest i can get lost in. not sure whether to ditch my stable comfy life for the unknown once more. all signs point to yes. i will be interested to visit the void point and see what it brings up for me. as a side note the very first random attractor i got was the house of a psychic. been thinking of getting a reading for a while now. down the road from the psychic is a guy called 'magic karl'. i had to laugh. i'm going to try combining these points with rituals /spells. anyone else done this?"

the void - weird experience involving bricks,2019-04-16,"i visited a void today and it was near the end of a cul-de-sac and i had a strange experience. at the end of the road was a cement barricade and on the other side of the barricade is the entrance to a steep ravine. just on the other side of the barricade is a bunch of old bricks. the day before i was mentioning to my buddy that i wanted/was planning on making raised garden beds. i had recently gotten some older pallets and wanted to get a bit fancy and raise them. so when i saw these bricks i was thinking, heck yeah! perfect for up cycling and reusing. note: the bricks are on land behind a concrete barricade and they are not on anyones property. eventually a road will probably go through there in 10 years but it is all overgrown ravine past the barricade. so i thought id grab a few and this lady came out of her house with a baby on her hip. her: hey there, what are you doing? me: i was walking around a noticed these brick sitting awhile by themselves on the other side of the barrier in the ditch. her: the neighbours are still using those, but i'll check with them and if they are throwing them away - you can have them next week. *goes back inside her house* i realized she didnt get my name or number so i went to ring her door to give her my phone# / email address to get ahold of me and there was no answer at all. it was weird. i got goosebumps from it."
break on through to the other side....,2019-04-16,"went to my first attractor point yesterday. wasn't feeling too dispair-y.... just a little nervous energy. first one led to a corn field, too far to walk on someone else's property so i didn't get out of the car. the location was right on top of a single tree kinda off by itself. nothing too strange... but as we approached the location break on through by the doors began to play and we just looked at eachother. how fitting! saw some trash and a tractor passed by us, but he waved and was friendly. no strange or zombie like behavior, but we were in the middle of no where in a gravel road..so seems strange we would have someone pass us for the 2 mins we were there.. second location was behind an auto repair shop named car-x ( x marks the spot? ). it was a giant cage full of tires waiting to be recycled with one single tire lying beside it. number on the side was 331. beside the shop was a ""road to nowhere"", a road that lead to a dead end of grass. no artifacts were found, just more trash. on the way home saw 3 random ppl in 3 blue hammocks. tried to visit a 3rd location but the bot was down. 3 seems to be a common recurrence on these explorations. was interested to see what was at the 3rd location. if i go back out i will def bring a trash bag and clean up along the way! had a strange fear after that maybe going there had changed things for the worse... despair meme? btw i am mandela effected and have experienced flip flops."

met a nice dog,2019-04-16,"i generated a medium-powered attractor today, and went to investigate. i wound up inside a building, and while there wasn't much on the first floor i went to the second and found a concrete ""platform,"" which looked like a former pillar cut down during a remodel. the platform was exactly where the location marker said i should be, so i stood on it and focused on an intention for a moment. as i stood there, a woman appeared from around the corner with a dog. she saw me and fell to the floor (literally) giggling, acting both startled and amused, then continued on toward the stairs, leaving the dog behind to jump up and smell my hands/get a good head scratch. after a few minutes the dog hopped down and continued on after her. i left feeling very a very positive energy. curious to see if anything happens from the intention setting. picture of me standing on the platform: [https://imgur.com/a/rdkccki](https://imgur.com/a/rdkccki)"

first visit. void. power 1.68.,2019-04-17,"finally decided to give this randonaut stuff a try. i love it. combines my love of exploration with my love of strangeness and paranormal. i messed around with the fatum bot for a bit, before i got a location i knew how to get to. this was a void, and eerily enough, it appeared on google maps as a large empty area with no markings or roads in the middle of the city. no idea what it was. i decided to make this my detour on the way home via bike commute. it went down a road that i've been before, but never felt comfortable going down, though it was familiar enough. eventually i crossed an intersection and had to go up a one-way street i've never been up before. so, i had ""wrong way"" signs facing me the whole time. i kept going up the hill and road. it was approaching 11:00 at night, and so everything was dark and this road really looked like it went nowhere. eventually i saw i was above a giant parking garage. parking garages always gave me a weird feel. i don't know. they just always brought to mind those fight scenes that happen in highlander and other shows and movies. always expect a guy in a trench coat with a sword to come at me. lol. anyway, i was starting to wonder where the exact location was, because i was worried i might be above it and have no real way of conveniently getting to it. http://i.thinimg.com/img/7rk9.jpg but i kept going up the road and came to a [large parking lot](http://i.thinimg.com/img/7rkb.jpg). the roof of a giant parking garage. there were still some cars and people, but they were far off on the other end of it. the location was inside this. so, i hopped off my bike and decided to push it past the closed gate and get inside. the location marker was very close. i walked past a stairwell marked [""stairway 6""](http://i.thinimg.com/img/7rkh.jpg) and walked to right on top of the marker. oddly enough, it was right on top of what look two footprints. (unfortunately, the lighting was awful, and the pictures i snapped of it are jet black. i'll try and fix it after i post this.) i made a point of standing right on the foot prints. looked around. it was a big ol' parking garage in the middle of the city. next to giant corporations. it felt like a landing pad in the middle of the city. i took some pictures. and then went home. i'm not sure any anomalies existed, or occurred other than the strong coincidence of the location marker being right on top of a pair of footprints. i didn't feel the despair-meme or anything like that. it just felt exploring. pics: http://i.thinimg.com/img/7rkg.jpg http://i.thinimg.com/img/7rkl.jpg http://i.thinimg.com/img/7rkm.jpg http://i.thinimg.com/img/7rkn.jpg yeah. blurry. i know. but pics make a post more fun and interesting and those are what i got."

interesting first adventure in sydney,2019-04-18,"headed out for a jog on foot about 2.5 km for my first attractor. discovered a little part of sydney i've never been through before. said hello to a few interesting characters along the way :) pretty much spot on the location was a yard sale. i've circled the 'no unauthorized access permitted' lol http://i.thinimg.com/img/7rsq.jpg there was a sun on the door http://i.thinimg.com/img/7rst.jpg and there was a statement about the aboriginals with the words 'with our own spirits to guide us'. http://i.thinimg.com/img/7rsu.jpg and finally a few metres away, an artwork discarded http://i.thinimg.com/img/7rsw.jpg more adventures to follow :)"

morning walk,2019-04-18,"spawned a void outside my front door, 40 metres away, there was nothing of interest. i walked on, letting my dog pick the way, she took me towards the point my very first attractor a week ago: https://imgur.com/mgeoydu https://imgur.com/tarejwx https://imgur.com/0evdtc3 moving on, i saw a burnt out car, went to take a photo, but my dog refused to follow, i stood on a piece of wood and a screw penetrated through my shoe to my foot, just avoided piercing my skin. my dog looked at me with a knowing look. a man appeared from nowhere, smiled and greeted me, as i hopped about trying to remove the foot wood: https://imgur.com/blezqup https://imgur.com/nckx5g9 decided to set a few voids and attractors and visit them random fashion if they were in my vicinity. first took me to a georgian house popular with dog walkers, my dog took me to a rabbit hole, and some ponds called 'monk's caves'. legend has it there's a network of tunnels under this place that lead to the local cathedral/ former abbey: https://imgur.com/ixgxl8b https://imgur.com/07tiecu had one more location nearly skipped it as was running out of time, but a squirrel led my dog in the direction and that sealed it: https://imgur.com/tjiv7rd https://imgur.com/mtxzb4g there were a few personal syncs and oddities along the way also, a couple of people appearing from gates and backing away watching me and closing the gates."

good god i love this!,2019-04-19,"i discovered this just yesterday, and decided to do 3 randoms in 24 hours to check it out and it has been so awesome! 1. my first-ever random landed right in the middle of the san francisco bay, haha! as a result of that experience i learned how to set the radius, which defaults to 5000 meters. nevertheless, i was actually able to get there by taking my first ever ferry ride in the bay! it was so worth it - the trip was incredible and filled with awesome symbolism for me. 2. the second trip was to a sweet little boutique hotel less than 1000 meters from the office i work in (that's the minimum radius.) i had always wanted to check it out but i never did, and it's a hidden gem of a lobby to get a drink or hang out in, and the name of the hotel was also very positively symbolic. an amazing place downtown to read or study. i'll be back! 3. third trip was to a grade school that had a kids test laying on the sidewalk at the exact point. the paper said: *vocabulary skills, reading skills,* and *study skills.* i have a number of writing related projects in the works, so this was cool for me and i got a strong message to simplify things from it and to start creating from a much less complicated vibe. (i can sometimes overcomplicate things.) anyway, the best part of the experience was the **dopamine** hit, and how responsive people were to me as i was heading out to my spots. perceptibly different. nodding, saying hello. and i felt perceptibly different as i was doing this...it's like you just allow yourself to enjoy having the experience of disrupting the simulation, and between that and the heightened perception you start maybe seeing things a bit symbolically and it feels good. love it! next up: working with the attractors and setting intentions. this is an amazing experiential tool and synthesizes a lot of things for me."

my first try as a randonaut!,2019-04-19,"hey! first time ever here, be kind please! i'm learning. my name is fred, i live in mrsta, outside stockholm in sweden. i heard about this from the great tommie kelly, a british occultist/magican who mentioned this on his patreon and i just had to try it - mostly because it can involve walking, and i love walking ;) i was very impressed and it gave me a lot; for example a sense of adventure and something unexpected. i honestly don't understand the science behind it, the use of quantum randomness etc to choose these locations, so excuse me for being a mumbling idiot about it on the video i shot from my first excursion! my first thought was to find something that's connected to me (kinda like use intuition while using tarot), and i'm impressed - even if it's quite far-fetched - by my first discovery, but the second one i guess was more fitting and correct (if there's something like that in this experiment?) to what i was doing.

my first time!,2019-04-19,"greetings tl:dr: saw a worn out basketball with xavier written on it locked behind a small gate of someones backyard. as we walked away and crossed the street to film the place for better analysis; we hear a loud bouncing basket ball coming from the direction of the house. it bounced three times with forces - dribbled on spot, before it began to cease. it was during work hours, where the streets are empty. i have been following this project for a little while and have finally had the chance to visit an attractor; fortunately, it was but a 6 minutes walk and decided to visit it with my wife. the bot directed me to a rather peculiarly vibrant home amidst a line of generic homes, which was decorated with many sorts of colorful objects. as we explored the house, which was ordinary in every other aspect of design, i realized that i must trespass upon the property. i pulled out my phone and turned on the map app to seem lost, should someone confront me. we came upon a locked gate that lead to the back yard and noticed a worn out and fading white and blue colored basketball of the brand: xavier, of which i had never heard of and reminded me of prof. x and st. francis xavier collge. nothing else, i shrugged it off and thought that i might be reading too much into it. we decided to leave and take another look from afar. i decided to to film the place, just incase. after doing so, we crossed the street to take a different perspective and go back home. upon which, we hear a basketball bouncing, i immediately laugh with astonishment. whether it was indeed an anomaly or some random person dribbling a different ball st the distance; the probability of such an event at this proximity is simply awe inspiring, least to myself. thank you."

[attractor](https://i.imgur.com/vgxfa3l.jpg) [void](https://i.imgur.com/t4vdex0.jpg) before we went to the attractor point we went under a bridge that had a max height of 11 ft for any passing vehicles. the void point was very clearly a house and then there was that weird tall basin thing with the wood neatly stacked up. im going to try to go back to that one tomorrow when its daytime to see what it actually looks like!

question of theory,2019-04-22,"**tldr version:** what appears to us as 'true' randomness (quantum randomness) is a function of a simulation and therefore determined? &amp;#x200b; forgive me if i've missed something.... i was brought to the page, like many of us, by the medium article on hacking 'the simulation'. although in the fatum theory on github there is no reference to a simulation theory *per se,* i can see the link between the notion of probability tunnels and a meta-world computer simulation. upon reading the theory i was taken, and engaged in the project on the basis that i fully subscribe to a general theory of holistic determination (i.e. sum total of causal effects in the course of a life significantly restricts and quite possibly determines outcome, combining gene function, education, exposure [et.al](https://et.al).). &amp;#x200b; what i don't understand is the link between fatum's quantum randomness and disrupting the posited meta-simulation. the argument of fatum's theory is that quantum randomness is the only true randomness because algorithmic randomness is not truly random, it is determined by cause and effect. therefore if our experience of existence as we know it is a simulation, which by its very nature is deterministic, and that simulation is an output of the advanced technology of our descendants, then all randomness generated within it is deterministic. while at the simulation level our experience of quantum randomness appears truly random, it is, in the frame of a simulated reality wholly and completely determined. &amp;#x200b; while fatum can take us to places we would never normally be, give us new perspectives and broaden our understanding through exposure to new circumstance, it can't act to disrupt a hypothetic simulation. in fact, its randomness is only random outside a simulation. &amp;#x200b; thought?"

this isnt what it seems,2019-04-22,"after careful consideration i will not be continuing this. i ran this by some in the know people and they all thought it wasnt a good idea. heres why: 1. i see the logic in wanting to confuse the matrix and how the app works, but the way these points are being generated (by an app) means the matrix is still in control of generating these points, defeating the purpose of doing so. 2. i havent ever found anything good at these points. i also received a lot of 666 numbers throughout the few days i was doing it. i think its possible that though the matrix limits us, to a certain extent it protects us from other dimensions bleeding in. by going to these points, you could essentially be consenting by going to these glitch points where stuff from outside can get to you where they normally couldnt. 3. i had nightmares/night terrors the couple of days i tried this. i also had a feeling of dread both days (i believe this was talked about with dispairmeme). this is my personal experience, so obviously not saying this will happen to you but listen to your gut"

open minded skeptics first try,2019-04-22,so i saw a recent post describing how all this works and i figured i would give it a shot. i have days off during the week so it wouldnt be too difficult. i still dont know exactly what im looking for or how this will effect me either good or bad hypothetically if it works....so i should still probably do some more reading so 2 hrs ago i had to go to krogers anyways and decided i would give it a try. got a pair 1.4 and 1.6. within 2 miles. first place is attractor just past krogers a ways. get in my truck and it takes me to the parking lot of a church next to an elementary school. church had some business going on and the school next door had kids playing outside. didnt really feel like being the older guy hanging out near a park of kids alone ha so i drove slowly trying to see if there was anything i should notice. at this time the small speaker above my head in my truck... just starts buzzing loudly like it has feedback. never done this before i should mention. so thats interesting i think. is reality about to fuck my truck up to keep me from going places? so i just head to krogers real quick with it buzzing... do my shopping and get back in my truck. buzzing is gone. so i head to the void area. a small street that i have driven past daily for 10 years. i always thought it was just a subdivision. it opens up into a country road with moderate houses and nice atmosphere. the buzzing in my speaker starts back up at this point. finally coming to a small subdivision off of that street. my location is someones house. on the porch is an attractive woman eating cereal in the middle of the day. i laughed to myself at parking and walking up to her and telling her quantum destiny brought us together. she waved as i drove past. i wasnt going to be going around peoples houses either. so i head home and the buzzing again stops. interested enough ill have to expand my radius and give it another try my next day off.

[weird experience with bricks pt 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/randonauts/comments/bdnlq9/the_void_weird_experience_involving_bricks/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) i have returned a week later to the spot with the bricks and they are still there. so i went over to the neighbours house (that the brick-hate keeping lady referred to) and knocked on the door. an older gentleman appeared and i explained to him my story about walking and seeing the bricks and about the lady and wanting to make raised garden beds with the bricks. he said he was only planning on using some of them and that if i helped him load the some bricks into his yard i could have the left over ones. i cant believe it. what an interesting quest to get bricks. in short: i was looking for bricks, generated a point with the bot, the gatekeeper of the bricks told me to wait a week, i waited a week, came back, had to help the keeper of the bricks and now have bricks."
i became the fatum bot when it was down,2019-04-24,"the other day when the bot was down i decided to try and be the bot myself. ( i know it doesn't work quite like that ) on a morning run i saw some escalators with both sides travelling in the down direction which was weird. running up escalators that are travelling down is really hard! &amp;#x200b; [http://i.thinimg.com/img/7tm8.jpg](http://i.thinimg.com/img/7tm8.jpg) &amp;#x200b; at the top i found this empty rooftop. &amp;#x200b; [http://i.thinimg.com/img/7tm9.jpg](http://i.thinimg.com/img/7tm9.jpg) &amp;#x200b; i'd been past those escalators a few times and never bothered to see what's at the top. it was all pretty cool as i didn't know this empty space existed. to get down i saw a lift in the distance and thought 'why not'? i'm being the fatum bot :) remembering, all of this was my decision as the bot wasn't working that day. &amp;#x200b; flash forward to this morning. called up the bot, set radius to 3500m. it gives me the exact location of the lift in the distance that i took the other day. i thought, perhaps my location was stored from the previous visit and somehow the bots using that, but i didn't take my phone on the first visit, i left it at home. [http://i.thinimg.com/img/7tmd.jpg](http://i.thinimg.com/img/7tmd.jpg) &amp;#x200b; only thing of note was a homeless man sleeping near the bottom of the lift. i'm not sure what the odds are in a 3500m radius, but it seemed weird."

new to this and still not sure what this is about,2019-04-24,"so i did do a little reading on it and tried it yesterday. i was really nervous before going but pushed myself to do so after about an hour after getting an attractor. i didn't find anything unusal at the location point and mildly disapointed but realived i went however i saw stuff i either didn't notice until on the way there or changed from what i remembered. i live in a trailer park which it directed me to a different location in the same park and didn't want to look suspicious taking photos so i didn't. the single birch tree in my front yard is now 2 growing really close together and had a black bag stuck between it, a neighbor's birdbath was now an angel statue that looks like it been there forever which i never remember seeing, and there was an arrow stuck in the ground near their fence which i've never noticed before. so i went home and went to bed after this. all day today interactions with people online have been strange. stuff like talking about ai, talking in doubles or basically two different people making the exact same posts, people suggesting themselves as dead but not in the sense of ""i'm so dead right now"" but like ""i saw this when i was dead"" and similar as well as refering to me as dying at certain points of my life when i've had near misses and me having super powers because of it. basically very strange coversations that aren't normal with these people."

the mcdonalds smell,2019-04-24,"just a quick one. took my son out for his first fatum outing today, nothing really interesting or photo-worthy, tiny bit of despair meme with us getting eaten alive by mosquitoes and one or two paths that felt like the bush was closing in around us. we were on our third point, had just arrived there and looking around a bit. both exhausted as we'd been out walking for a good 90 minutes. this is all in 100% bush trails (private property areas but zoned as non-development, long story) so no people or buildings around for a good kilometre radius or so. we saw a property divider marker with some letters and numbers on it and my kid joked that we should send it to the bot, maybe it'll come back and say ""congratulations you've won a free mcdonalds voucher!"" i laughed and said that would be some creepy shit and we started walking back. we get maybe 20m down the trail when all of a sudden i smell the very distinct scent of mcdonalds fries. i ask my son ""do you smell that?"", he replies ""is that maccas?"" the smell stuck around for about 200m of the trail before slowly fading. it definitely wasn't there on the way in, and there is absolutely no chance that it came from any actual maccas or other cooking. not a clue what it could have come from. anyway, nothing else particularly interesting, just a fun little footnote to our wandering."

watch out for technology gremlins!!!!,2019-04-24,"ok, here's a weird experience. i was stringing together a series of points, void, attractors, quantum while i was on a motorcycle ride in the suburbs of bangkok. also i was hungry. here's the experience: first stop was a void. a local thai man asked me what i was doing when i stopped; he came very close; i made hand motions that i was lost, smiled and he went away. when he was close to me i thought the void spot was a house, no, i realized it was a gated empty lot, that i literally did not see until i parked. looked like a house was planned, never was built. drove around more, reset the locations, played with quantums, pairs and attractors, and i quickly discovered new neighborhoods i never knew, and found lots of food. funny, as i was hungry, that ended being my strong intention. i wanted to find some good som tum; green papaya salad. stopped at a street vendor that sells green papaya and other salads. used a translation app on my phone...and you see the result. wtf?!?!? i asked a thai friend, ""does this really say, tip: do evil 55 (which in thai translates to lol as 5=hah, so 55 = haha! ) and they said, ""no, that says papaya salad with everything. isan style"". my translation app has never been that wrong , or that strangely aggressive. huh. was a very interesting day! saw a lot of new stuff and got a sense that this action with fatum bot is pressing against something, opening a door. kinda nice to switch things up. stay alert randomnauts!!!! don't trust your technology. gremlins get pissed if you go off the grid, or flex their structures. but you know what? we're all humans with free will. :-) i really like exploring this world, and i like choosing my own path. i'll keep on exploring randomly!!"

attractor #1 (3.24),2019-04-25,"23/4/2019 my best friend and i have tested the fabric of space-time. and it turned out to be a one-of-a-kind journey. we've decided to get our first attractor while strolling through the gorky park (alexa, play *wind of change* by scorpions) and... it didn't work. i was following the instructions, received a ""new location confirmed"" message from the bot and set the radius to 3000 meters. double checked everything. and the bot wanted us to visit an attractor in london! i know that everything is relative but in my reality london is 2500 kilometers (~1500 miles) away from gorky park. we'd both like to visit london but that's not the most interesting thing about this glitch. right before getting the attractor we've been discussing john mew's orthotropics and our attractor was located on... north mews. coincidence? i don't think so. ah yes, my friend thought that it might be my phone causing glitches but the attractor he got was also located in london. all in all, i've gone through the whole process once again, set everything to default, updated my location and got a new attractor, this time in moscow and only 1 kilometer away which was reassuring. each of us thought of something special as the setting sun was painting the sky red and orange, looming over the river moscow and the gigantic blazing glass body of the luzhniki stadium across it. imagine elms and lindens so old they had seen the tsar. underneath themtwo tiny humans lost in the universe but with hearts so big that the futility of being almost seemed absurd. and everywhere around themcolor-changing outdoor lights making the park they saw a hundred times before seem alien and otherworldly. the scene was set for us. and so our journey began. we walked and we sang and we laughed and we were happy. ""meet me when the sun is in the western skies"" goes one of the greatest songs in the history of humanity. what will we meet? our fate? a glitch so strange that the universe might collapse? nothing? all in all, the atmosphere was as magical and fantastic as rainbow's music. there was a wide pond that we passed by on our way to the attractor and an info plate to help strollers define the trees growing in the park. somehow it caught our attention but there was nothing special about it. besides, according to my phone, it was far enough from our point of interest. we went on and eventually fetched a compass, as the road took a downhill turn. and only when we reached the foot of the hill i understood that my gps was lagging and we had to go back, as the attractor was located somewhere close to that info plate. we climbed the hill and my friend said that the trees almost look artificial and duplicated. we were close. ""oh look it's there!"" another info plate that none of us noticed before. and thus i had an answer i've been searching for. the plate contained a short article about the historical background of the hill where we stood. nothing much, as i was captivated by the title. there's a russian saying: which is literally translated as ""moscow wasn't built in a day"". it means that everything takes time and nothing can be done overnight. this phrase was exactly what i needed. but i felt like there was something else to be found... i turned around and saw the same pond and the first info plate, 15 meters from where we stood. i knew that it was therethe answer my friend was looking forbecause he was the one to notice the plate. i turned on my phone flashlight and started searching for somethingi knew it had to be an object. and i found it on the bank of the pond close to the water, almost invisible and covered in last year's leaves. it was an [artificial flower](https://imgur.com/a/zwb9ovg). what's most interesting is that a part of its stem and one bud had been melted down. who would do that to a flower and most importantly who would bring it there? in russia we use artificial flowers for home decor but not the ones like thissuch flowers are mostly used when you visit a grave... there are no cemeteries anywhere close to where we've been. and even if someone put it on the pond's bank why was is melted? it was our first quantum journey. but definitely not the last. p.s. give the title another look. my best friend has been haunted by the combination of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 for the past couple of years. i've been seeing them often for the past month or so as well. attractor power and the date (23/4) have them. no big deal but it put a smirk on my face."
1st attractor - half time,2019-04-25,"so i have generated my first attractor and went there. from my work. during my lunch break. i really wanted this experience to be unexpected and out of the blue, so it would be very random. my attractor was behind a mall, where i sometimes go for lunch. i never even thought of the fact that something might actually be behind the mall. you know, that weird image in your brain, where you create a mind map of a place and you never really think of what is behind the house you walk by every day. there are trails. tracks and trails and a construction site and a very old destroyed house. it's huge. there are flags with a logo of our public transportation system on them. i didnt even know those existed. though people obviously go there - there are paths of people who obviously walked around a lot - there is nothing. the paths end at the trails, but there is no train station. doesn't make any sense to a logical mind. why would so many people walk around to create a path when there is nothing there? and then i saw the magazine on the ground. i am in the czech republic, ""poloas"" is the czech word for ""half-time"", as in a game. i was on my lunch break. it was 12 o'clock. half of the day gone. half of the game. creepy as f. https://i.redd.it/1s6sszan3eu21.jpg"

(a tractor.. right?) sometimes it's creepy figures or even just similar despair memes. anyone else find this cool? could us opening attractors at similar times mean we find similar artifacts/objects/scenery? could that lead onto collective consciousness? i've done a little reading about hermetics (just the kybalion at this point) which had lead from me reading into neville goddard.. one of the hermetic principles, in fact the first principle is the all is mind; the universe is mental - suggestive of collective consciousness? i'm just intrigued to hear other views on this."

what is truly random?,2019-04-28,"hi guys, ive never travelled to an attractor location or anything but for sure im interested into all the theories behind it. so it is for sure that these points are truly random as the use of quantum physics (fatum bot, the vacuum numbers) ensures, but what about the things that lead up to us reaching those points? like i stumbled into you guys via r/reconned, which i stumbled into via research on the mandela effect. if i used fatum bot following these factors, wouldnt that be predetermined? and for the pilgrimage, other people in the world arent using fatum, so theyre in sync. that would mean my means to get to the attractor location is no longer randomized? i guess im just wondering to what degree are we un-randomized in order to search for randomness in our lives"

weird things at first (weak-ish) attractor point,2019-04-29,"a few days ago, i went on my first walk to an attractor point which was located in a nearby forest. going up there, the roads were blocked - i swear to god. i live in a very desolate area where it sometimes feels like you're all alone on earth. apparently a tree had fallen down and had to be removed before the roads were opened again. there was no other way to get up there so i waited for quite a while. i laughed about it because it reminded me of the scene in ""the truman show"" when he tries to escape the set but can't because there's all sorts of excuses. at first it was a little creepy; i had to park near an abandoned summer camp from soviet times but then i went on the walk and it was pretty normal, nothing out of the ordinary. i took my dog with me and he had fun enjoying the path we had never taken before. when i got to the attractor point in the middle of the forest, nowhere near any track, i found this on the floor - i really didn't put this there. i don't know if it ""means"" anything or if anything does, anyway, but i found it a little odd. it had been stormy before so maybe that explains it but still i found it kind of odd. (first picture below.) it was a special experience and i felt some sort of way i couldn't explain. maybe because you open yourself up to feeling things and expecting something special. i know you're not supposed to do that, but there was something about the silence and the storm and the light. anyway so i'm just scrolling through my photos of the day and i found this (second picture below) in a photo of my dog. i've had a few weird experiences the past couple of days and then i find this weird little thing in in this photo?! i don't know. don't believe me, it's probably (most likely) everything explainable and normal and i just find this weird because it's an unusual context. but please look for yourself. &amp;#x200b; [i swear i didn't put this there to make an \\""x\\"". ](https://i.redd.it/r9r2qonfe9v21.jpg) [if you zoom in, into the little glitch, i swear i see something that looks like a face. also, don't mind my dog, he's just enjoying himself.](https://i.redd.it/00cdcyj0f9v21.jpg)"

a 4.54 just now - with a small locked door - pictures in post,2019-04-30,"i think it's so funny. i tend to do this during lunch breaks - i have this one colleague who i always go out for lunch, but whenever he is not at work, i use my lunch break to just explore the quantum. i always return to the office, like just now, and everybody just assumes i went somewhere to eat by myself. anyways, half an hour ago i just returned from another journey. at first i thought i wouldnt make it in time, as it looked far away on the map, but it was actually pretty close. funny part was that it led me through streets named after places that my great-grandfather used to work and live at. me and my husband talked about him not too long ago. when i arrived there, i realized it was on the street where me and my husband got married. it was a small door in a house. *processing img 2hx60ehsqdv21...* i marked the door in the picture. you can also see the small hole under the window. just like a pixel missing. before we go on, i have to talk more about the architecture. in central europe, houses like this were built in 20s,30s, and the small doors were usually ""additions"" - because people started owning cars and motorbikes, they would create additional garages in the houses. this looks like one of them, but its surprisingly smaller. the garages usually resemble much more the door that is on the left of the central entrance door. about the ""pixel"" thing - central heating wasnt a thing, people had furnaces in rooms, and later on they were taken away and gas heating took place of those. for those little gas heaters, you have to create a little hole under the window just like that, like a little chimney. but it's usually a whole flat/house thing. none of the other flats, or even the rest of this one flat, has this hole! and when you stop using those, you just cement/brick them up! they are not even bricked or cemented. i am very enthusiastic about our local housing architecture, so it just hit me in the face. &amp;#x200b; https://i.redd.it/zvckuepsrdv21.png this is the door closer. there is also the hole - i couldnt reach it, i am too short. there are two (!!) locks on each side of the door. they were locked. but there was a tiny leaf in front of the door. i picked it up and carried it with me, back to work, in my pocket. &amp;#x200b; https://i.redd.it/qaibjao0sdv21.png"

"""nature wins"" - quantum chain (2 sites)",2019-04-30,"today i set out to do a two site chain. the first /getquantum took me back to a site i'd previously marked as an attractor (see this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/randonauts/comments/bgx0ta/i\_marked\_an\_attractor\_306/](https://www.reddit.com/r/randonauts/comments/bgx0ta/i_marked_an_attractor_306/)), which was a bit spooky. from there i generated a second, that led me to a mural titled ""nature wins."" i thought the artist's statement that went along with it was interesting, as was the abandoned storefront with the word ""kismet"" written across it that i found on my way home. here's an imgur gallery of my marked attractor (as it was today), the mural, the artist's statement, and the storefront: [https://imgur.com/a/ccglf3h](https://imgur.com/a/ccglf3h)"

my experiences with this experiment have led me to this idea:,2019-04-30,"&amp;#x200b; &amp;#x200b; we have some amount of choice and some amount of illusion of choice. when you play an open world ""choices matter"" video game, you can choose your alignment, you can choose how to respond to dialog, you can be a stealth archer or a mage or a thief.. you can choose to be to focus on the main quest line or go off exploring. you can focus on side quests and mini games and crafting.. you can be the fetch-quest hero, or the evil chicken kicker. you have all kinds of choices. &amp;#x200b; but at the end of the day, the game is still limited to what the game is limited to, and the closer you get to following/completing the main quest line, the more you see how your choices only ""matter"" in a very loose sort of definition of matter. &amp;#x200b; no matter how you play the game, you often end up at the same boss battle, for example. &amp;#x200b; we do have lots of choices here, it seems, but in a very ""video game esque"" way. &amp;#x200b; can we find easter eggs, and cheat codes and mods and bugs and places the game doesn't expect us to go? can we fly out into the ocean, past the edge of the map, and is there a grid there? and where is the exit menu?"

first time out! 6 attractor points visited,2019-05-02,"today i went out on my very first trip. i set my location to the middle of my university and radius to 1000 m. i did not want to stray too far from comfort this first time around. i didn't set any intentions but in hindsight, i think my desire to not want to travel far led (most) of my attractors to be nearby. i was in class when i asked fatum bot to locate the attractors and then set out after class. i want to note that i did not go in the order that fatum bot gave me, and there were attractors i decided not to visit because they were just a little bit too far out for me to walk to in the hour i gave myself to do this trip. &amp;#x200b; **first attractor \[1.19\]** *processing img xxc13e4yzov21...* this point was actually invalid, but i decided to go to it because it was right behind the building my classroom was. the attractor was this tree with a large growth. this is situated by a parking lot for the building i came out of. the car you see to the left was actually the only one nearby. it was an old lincoln car. i picked up a label for the red flowers that the landscapers had left behind. they are autumn sage in radio red. i've driven past this place probably a hundred times, but never really stopped to notice this area. &amp;#x200b; **second attractor \[2.51\]** *processing img 4djgic5r1pv21...* this point was in front of someone's yard, so i didn't stay too long. i stayed on the sidewalk, as i did not want to seem like i was trespassing, especially since the windows in the house had their shades all open. took this picture very quickly before heading out to the next destination. i didn't take anything with me from this point. &amp;#x200b; **third attractor \[1.30\]** *processing img fm56ryol2pv21...* on the map, it showed this point to be in an open space in between houses, but this area was actually an extension of the land of the house to the left of it. i didn't feel too badly about entering the lot, but i did hear a door from the house open and close, so i think someone took notice of me. i think the tree got struck by lightning. there was bark all over the area surrounding the tree. i took a small piece and left. &amp;#x200b; **fourth attractor \[9.74\]** *processing img khug2ogy3pv21...* *processing img 6u2vkin24pv21...* *processing img n9yz46h84pv21...* i was quite excited to get to this location since it had the highest points out of all the attractors i've gotten. first thing i noticed was the circle painted onto the cement. ""ah! x marks the spot!"" is what i was thinking. i stayed at this spot the longest. this area is actually on the way to a friend's place, whom i haven't visited since last summer. actually, when i downloaded telegram, this person had an account on there and messaged me. what a coincidence, huh? this was on a walking path on the side of the university gym. nice little area, actually. there were two really big trees that had some sort of metal nailed into them. i think they used these trees to hang a poster or something. there was also some sort of wiring hanging off of the second tree. i have no idea what it's purpose was. i picked up a plastic \[wiring?\] that was on the ground. i also took notice of this manhole. my gps locator isn't the most accurate, so the attractor point could have actually been the manhole instead of the circle i took notice of earlier, as they were only a few meters away. **fifth attractor \[1.90\]** *processing img av69ekuk6pv21...* oh no! someone's umbrella got messed up! we actually had pretty bad weather yesterday, so this most likely was the result of someone's unfortunate run-in with mother nature. they were doing some renovations to the land, which you can see in the background. i think the attractor was actually over there closer to the manhole, but didn't want to climb up the way to get there. there were also workers chilling nearby, so i think it would have been weird for a student to just go up and check out their work. **sixth attractor \[3.66\]** *processing img g609fxl67pv21...* this attractor led me to the back of one of the libraries, which also houses the department of two friends' majors. i haven't hung out with them since the beginning of the fall semester. i recall this because the map also reminded me of this fact lol (the department name). even though i've walked around this part of campus a lot, i never really noticed this tree. there was also a single bike rack nearby the building i never noticed. i think it got installed for the maintenance people as there is a door to their \[office\] right around the corner. it's kind of sad that they cut off all of these branches off of this tree. i think it's because they were low hanging branches at one time. the school houses some of the maintenance trucks here, so they were probably a nuisance scratching at the windows of the trucks. **other things** on the way to the second attractor, i noticed a play area behind a building i've had several classes in. i actually only walked this way once in my life, so it was cool to notice this. after i left the fourth attractor point, it began to sprinkle. i actually really hate getting caught in the rain, and my immediate thought was to seek shelter! but i progressed anyway. it ended up only sprinkling. on the way to the last attractor, it became sunny, but it was still sprinkling. weird, huh? this was a nice little adventure i set out on. honestly, i was bracing myself to feel the despair meme, but it never came. actually, i think i did feel that somewhat while scrolling through this subreddit a few days ago, when i first discover it. anyway, i'm hoping to find more bizarre things than what i found this time around."

question from a beginner,2019-05-03,"so from what i've read into this, the bot supposedly generates coordinates that will have some kind of meaning to us, or changes our reality or something based on our intentions (similar to law of attraction). am i correct on this, and if so, how do the randomly generated numbers have anything to do with a location? how could the bot possibly be aware of a location that could have such meaning? i get the whole concept that it takes us to locations that we never would have consciously gone to, but how can the anomalies be explained with people finding unusual things at their locations? or is this just a placebo effect where people take anything unusual at their attractor point as a 'manifestation'?

theory... reality instancing in accordance with prior human presence.,2019-05-07,"so, i've been watching and interpreting this data pool as best i can and have come up with a sort of theory. i keep getting the feeling that reality is 'instanced' like in a video game... the so-called random coordinates always seem to show signs of human presence lingering. i feel like, due to memory (storage) limitations, truly random coordinates aren't possible, even with qnr's, but instead we will get coordinates that someone else has already stopped and lingered at, or at least walked through with conscious awareness of their surroundings. (even the converging trails - the part of trailwalking where you would stop to consider your path forward.) so far this is the thematic value i'm seeing, based on the results being posted by the more rural explorers. it's a given in cities and inner towns that you would find evidence of human activity pretty much everywhere. it becomes significantly less likely to happen in areas more rural; and yet, the theme seems to be to find evidence of such at these supposedly random coordinates. i think of it as sort of like cloud-managed info. we are sharing a cloud of info in a probability field, which 'enhances probability' we end up in places already visited, because those locations have already been 'instanced' and do not require further memory expenditure - they do not require a fresh rendering, if you will. another way to say this is that we think we have broken off the default tunnel, and perhaps we have personally. but we seem to just end up 'stumbling' into someone else's predefined tunnel, rather than into the truly unknown. it is almost as if the truly unknown does not exist - or perhaps that the truly unknown cannot be hacked into because even when we think we've summoned the random we have actually summoned an alternate predefined reality tunnel. i find myself wanting to inquire as to whether or not everyone is reporting every result, or are most people inclined to ignore results that show nothing strange, and to only report the anomalies, which are usually signs of human presence..? i think that it's important that everyone report in every result, even if there is absolutely nothing anomalistic about the location. in fact, i now find myself hunting through here for non-anomalistic results as a means of trying to disprove my own theory. because so far my theory seems accurate, but i have no way of knowing if others are simply omitting results they did not note to be anomalistic. again, this all applies especially to points in nature, where one would find it strange to find the coordinates align with specific signs of prior human presence and activity, and not so much in a city or town, where one would not consider signs of human presence to be anomalistic unto itself. well, that's all for now."

"buckle up, it's a long post. part 1.",2019-05-09,"so, my friend and i have been doing these fatum hunts. we've had two weird hunts in the last few days, both taken place at night. so the first one : i opened the bot, asked my friend to think of a random number under 3000 for the radius (can't remember it exactly now, maybe in the 1700s) and set off around 10 at night. first attractor was 7.71, we had trouble getting to it - broken gate and half a danger of death sign on the fence post. (this ended up being thematic - watch this space) and the point was in a private field on the outskirts of our town. we got as close as we could; to the gate of the field and using our torches we saw a black mat on the ground beyond the gate and despair meme hit my friend pretty hard, so we didn't go any further. we worried it could be a bull in the field and late at night, we didn't want to risk it. rerolled an attractor, got a 5.28 back along the main road we came by. went back and stood directly on the point. it was on a bridge, we saw a strong currents sign (about the river i presume) and another telegraph pole with a danger of death sign. if anyone remembers from a comment of mine, this friend that i walk with recently lost two friends - i remember saying that it worried me as a direct side effect of these walks, whether i'm right or not is another matter. at this point, we saw three cars drove past at the same time. all the same make, one white, one black and one grey. their reg plates all had some part of the reg plate from the first person who died recently, the cars were also all the same type as theirs. my friend was a little upset by this for obvious reasons! so generate next point. 1.61, shopping store car park. we got there to the point and stood around. nothing really happened, nothing really to see until someone drove up, parked in front of the delivery vans for this store and gave us a lingering look. that spurred me on to reroll and get outta there. * next point was around 3.62 (i can't remember exactly now) and we walked towards it. we were delayed by a group of people we know and walked one of them home, as it was in the same area as this next point. so we walked, torches on up this quiet alleyway. nothing to see on the way up, getting this person home was easily done. the attractor turned out to be someone's back garden, the only thing to see was the three butterflies on the window facing the field we were in. we didn't really get it and we didn't want to hang around as it was nearing 2am at this point. so we go to walk home. we walk down the dark alleyway again, torches out. we freaked, because there was a body lying face down covered in blood. i shit you not, i thought they were dead. i ran over immediately, the person was still alive! just fallen over and banged their head pretty bad; they declined letting me ring an ambulance but let my friend and i walk them home, which we did. we got home around 3am, completely flabbergasted about the theme of the points surrounding death, accidents, etc etc. my friend took this especially on board given recent events in his personal life. thoughts? also, stay tuned for part 2... which was last night. either i'm losing my mind or shit is getting real."
part 2.,2019-05-09,"so here we go. my friend downloaded the telegram app and we decided to switch it up and let him generate the points for the walk. however.. and this is important: we got talking about how you can implement the points into google maps for directions and i hadn't realised this, i'd just been using telegram's map to get there. so i randomly generated a point just to implement it into gm. no intention, not even thinking about it as we were still talking and i was distracted. i set radius to 2222, just off the top of my head and rolled. i saw where the point was.. just near where someone i've been trying to get back into contact with works. i showed my friend and groaned. he asked how strong it was and i looked. 7.43. i groaned again, obviously a bit displeased because i'd heard recently that this person had no interest in talking to me again etc. didn't want to look like a stalker if i was spotted near where they worked etc.. anyway. it was a strong attractor so we went and we decided to approach it from a road behind as i didn't want to get spotted. we got there and it was behind a house at the end of a cul-de-sac and i experienced the worst despair meme i have ever experienced. we got there at 22:22, which i found kinda funny but as someone came out of their house barefoot and approached us, i wanted to scarper out of there sharpish. we went to a nearby alleyway and i was panicking a bit. i felt very wrong and very scared, not sure why. i got my friend to generate the next point from his phone, same radius as mine etc. the alleyway felt menacing and we left quickly as we became more scared. we walked to this next point via main road, we figured well lit etc. we were talking and this person i was trying to avoid seeing drove past, right as i looked round! we watched them drive away out of town and i remember groaning out loud like, of fucking course. we carried on to the next point, 5.22 and it was out of town a little bit. essentially we've been up there before but at the fork in the road, we always took the right hand turning. this point was at the end of the left hand turning. got down there, right on top of it and it was an animal feed farm. big sign with gbm on it and a phone number. telegraph pole right on the point next to a bright security light and camera. we hung around for maybe ten minutes and walked back. only thing of note was i freaked as our torches hit the hi vis jacket of a horse in the field and i thought it was gliding but my counterpart confirmed it was actually trotting. cute horse, didn't stop to give it a stroke though as still felt weird. also, we haven't taken any artifacts on this walk or the previous one. we got back into town and rerolled. 5.92... and it was in the garden of the best friend of this person i was trying to avoid. my initial reaction was christ almighty no. but i couldn't ignore the high value and i figured we would just walk past, so we did. nothing to see and we walked past this point, getting as close as we dared without stopping. got round the corner and rerolled again. 10.41. i was in shock when my friend said, as i was observing a car sticker that said moore is more with a symbol that looked like an atom with the website underneath. 10.41. i couldn't believe it. we hurried along, not stopping to go to the toilet as we were both excited! we got there and it was in someone's front garden. i figured fuck it, we're already doing something outside the norm, we'll just go down there quickly and go back to the road. we got there and the point was a satellite and a bush of clematis montana mayleen. we couldn't make a connection so we exited and sat on the pavement and researched the meanings of satellite and the bush, respectively. satellite : communications. we've found a lot of telegraph poles and didn't understand it as such.. so the bush. clematis montana mayleen. mayleen : maia/month of may. maia. maya. illusion. the bush specifics was about how good it's used for screening. we sat dumbfounded for a while and chatted about varying ideologies like gnostics and the archons, the premise behind stargate sg1 etc etc, chatting about the simulation theory etc for a while. right as we were chatting, this person drove past us again! i groaned out loud and laid down on the pavement laughing. i'm still in shock, really. my friend and i noticed a trend that the previous night was centred about them and their fears and desires, whereas last night seemed more about me and mine. thank you for reading all of this! any thoughts, comments, tips etc would be appreciated. again, i would like to point out that this fatum hunt started out accidentally with no intention set. i remember saying to my friend last week i would like to see the difference between setting an intention and not. i guess i got my answer."

first experience! felt a little creeped out that it led me to bones,2019-05-12,"went on my first attractor point adventure, it led me to a desolate place in the woods on a back road that i didnt even know was there. at first i though it led me to....nothing. just grass and trees. then i noticed a path that opened up into the forest. i walked into the clearing and the first thing i found was bones. what kinds of bones are these by the way? after that it felt like i was being watched. i looked around the area some more and found a little baby turtle hiding in the bushes. maybe thats who was watching me. it was pretty exciting finding cool stuff on my first trip. definitely gonna try this some more. those are just animal bones right?!?! https://imgur.com/a/b0vbwms"
escaping reality tunnels through whirling,2019-05-13,"several times i've read about people trying to hack the matrix by turning in random directions. for example, a person goes to an empty parking lot and sets up markers, such as cones, in a grid, or uses the parking lines as markers. the person then walks down the line of markers, at each mark they turn left or right, choosing the direction randomly and *at the last moment.* it's important to choose at the last moment, in an attempt to conceal from the matrix which direction you will take, and thus, which direction the universe needs to present to you. it's an attempt to overload the sim, by removing the sim's anticipatory mechanism, which theoretically increases processing requirements. if the user goes over the max processing speed of the sim, hacks and miracles can occur. that brings me to this post. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/sufi_whirling . in sufi whirling, whirling dervishes are people who spin in place, in a religious dance, in an attempt to meet god. wiki explains it: &gt;it is a customary meditation practice performed within the sema, or worship ceremony, through which dervishes (also called semazens, from persian ) aim to reach the source of all perfection, or kamal. this is sought through abandoning one's nafs, egos or personal desires, by listening to the music, focusing on god, and spinning one's body in repetitive circles, which has been seen as a symbolic imitation of planets in the solar system orbiting the sun. ""spinning one's body in repetitive circles."" why? ""to reach the source of all perfection."" sounds a lot like simulation hacking to me."

3.01 attractor: lady in a pink sweatshirt,2019-05-16,"ive had the telegram app downloaded for maybe a month now. started with quantum but was having trouble generating a feasible point to get to. moved on to attractors/voids and after sorting threw a bunch of unattainable pins, i found a few i could actually get to. not much happened, maybe i was looking too hard or not waiting long enough at locations. pretty much wrote off the whole concept but was able to keep going forward with it as its something to do on my motorcycle. all was uneventful until today! i generated a 3.01 attractor a few miles from my work and departed on my lunch break. the point landed in a cemetery so i thought it had to be something good. i get to the cemetery, park my bike, and walk to the point. as i approach it, i notice a woman walking toward me in the distance. nothing out of the ordinary, pink sweatshirt, khakis, and sneakers. i didnt pay too much attention to her as my point was a few yards away. i got to the tree (where the pin landed) and looked around a bit. not much to notice other than this woman walking by. i notice her, smile, and nod in a friendly manner. that was that. somewhat disappointed, i left the cemetery and went back to work. after i got off at 5pm, the sun had come out. so i decided to hit the road again and explore on my supermoto. no randonauting this time as i just wanted to enjoy the open road. after riding out of town into the boonies, i enjoyed the winding roads and warm air. at this point i must have been 10-15 miles from the place i work. i turn a corner and notice a pedestrian walking along the road. i give them space by moving to the center of the road and as i do so, i cant help but notice her bright pink sweatshirt. it was the exact same lady i saw in the cemetery. i couldnt believe it, i had to do a double take. for whatever reason i continued to ride away. i immediately regretted that after getting back home. i think i should have spoken to her to see what she had to say. anyways my hope/interest in regards to randonauting has been revived. hope something comes of all this invested time!"

"if visiting an ""attractor point"" takes you off of your ""set path"", wouldnt us simply viewing your picture take us off our ""set path"" as well?",2019-05-16,"maybe im thinking about this to much or maybe there is something that i dont understand. what i have gathered from lurking here is that when you visit an ""attractor point"" it takes you off of your predestined path, resulting in some strange occurences. well if this is true when someone takes a picture of their ""attractor point"" and uploads it here, wouldnt that picture also not have been predestined, meaning it wasnt supposed to happen? and wouldnt us simply looking at a picture that was theoretically never supposed to be taken and uploaded to reddit take us the viewers off of our own ""predestined"" path as well, resulting in some kind of quantum chaos?"
found this sub yesterday - this morning had a couple strange occurrences already,2019-05-16,"found my way here from edamamemonster's post in r/dimensionjumping yesterday. i instantly fell down the rabbit hole, reading the links to the fundamentals of the fatum and to various experiences. i downloaded telegram, and connected to the bot... set my location and ran a test with a 3,000 meter radius just to see what came up. then i closed the app and forgot about it for the rest of the night. but, obviously i set an intention into the matrix. i walk to work every morning... same route... takes about 25 mins. this morning as i started my walk, i tuned into a randonaut podcast (adventures in woo woo) to learn more about it. as i'm leaving the house, a woman across the street whom i've never met was leaving her house and yelled ""good morning!"" to me - really loudly lol. i didn't think much of it and walked down the lane. i was 1/3 of the way to work and about to turn right onto a different street when this black van pulled up and stopped in the intersection (he had no stop sign) and sat there. i glanced at the driver as i turned the corner and he was just sitting in the van staring at me with a smile on his face. this time i noticed it as being odd. usually i don't pass anyone on my walk to work. occasionally there is another person or two walking in my direction, but that's about it. today when i was about 2/3 of the way to work, i came upon a blonde woman in a black jacket and gray pants, standing on the corner of the sidewalk talking into her white cell phone, which she was holding up to her mouth. i guessed she was a reporter, because her white news van was parked about 20 feet down the street. i didn't think much of it... but at the very next intersection, there was another blonde woman with a black coat and gray capri pants, holding a white phone in front of her face, looking into a parking lot where her white minivan was parked. i mean.... what the $*%#. the entire experience was *highly* unusual even without the repetition of the blonde woman. with it, it is... inexplicable. since falling down the rabbit hole last weekend which led me to r/thetruthishere and then r/mandelaeffect followed by r/dimensionjumping and now here.... strange things like this have been happening around me."

let's do a prospective randomised double-blind placebo-controlled study,2019-05-16,"so i found a post out on r/dimensionjumping mentioning the basics of this sub and i thought this was a pretty neat idea. however, when talking about whether or not the reports of these explorations contain bias, having significant results identifying the placebo matters greatly. how about we do something that makes this a bit more interesting by adding a prospective randomised double-blind placebo-controlled test? this whole endeavor would benefit greatly from these additions. instead of having everyone follow through with the same code, why not create two different groupings for finding places to explore. group 1 contains people whose qrng puts them into a category to use a pseudo rng to come up with places to explore. group 2 consists of people whose qrng splits them into a category where they are given actual qrng locations. one could argue that using qrng matters greatly on whether or not people could be allowed to use qrng for locations but i think it's an interesting idea nonetheless to make the results better suited to the scientific method. if in the future this study is performed again, another study that splits participants should be done using a pseudo rng instead to see if the reports are affected. who knows? maybe the qrng will favor someone over someone else? through this method, we would be taking into account whether or not the locations that people go to are actually based off qrng or pseudo rng. something that might help is having an id given to people to use while they do reports that help identify the qrng participants vs the pseudo rng participants. reports having ids will allow mods to compile that information so that we have test data for qrng reports vs pseudo rng reports. having both would make it a lot easier to see if the effects like void memes or despair memes are something that is actually unique to qrng. this would make identifiers of causation a lot easier to see. if someone thinks that they are being led by qrng, they might get hopeful and affect the results of their reports. however, if we do a prospective randomised double-blind placebo-controlled study we'll get better data. it could be that the qrng shifts your field. it could also be that your perception of having being led by qrng would also shift your field. this should be taken into account."
first set of attractors,2019-05-17,"i've been following this sub for a few weeks now, and have been planning on doing some trips while my wife is out of town. tonight i did first round. i set the minimum radius, as i wanted a fairly short, walkable route. i planned on doing three attractor points, and see how i felt from there. the first attractor was 3.64. nothing too remarkable, and no sense of despair. the only thing worth noting was a few churches on the corner. this was literally 3 blocks from my house. next attractor was 1.45 and only 2 blocks from the first place. again, no despair, but there was another church. third attractor was 3.24 and was at this post-mastectomy store. this spot was again, only a few blocks away from both my apartment and the other two attractor points. maybe there's something or someone in the general area i should have talked with? or not? since this three were so close and didn't seem to elicit much of a visceral response, i decided to do a second round of three. this was 2.46, and futher from my first cluster of spots, but still pretty near my house (which i suppose was a function of the radius). no despair, no unusual experiences or discoveries. my next attractor was invalid, so i decided to call it at 4. &amp;#x200b; as i did my route, i started to think about quantum entanglement and how truly random an experiment like this can be- and if we're all bound to the same quantum reality since we were all drawn to this experiment. i also thought about how often i've found myself in completely random situations in my life; and i got to wondering if i've spent my life seeking out the random, will an experiment like this actually lead me to the mundane? &amp;#x200b; hoping to do a few more rounds in the next week, and hoping to throw some fungi into the mix."

similarities between the fatum project and stephen king's dark tower.,2019-05-19,"has anyone else read the dark tower series? in the 5th or 6th book we learn about a priest who discovers ""highways in hiding."" these highways take you to different places in the multiverse, or different americas, as they're described in the book. the highways are usually filled with graffiti or trinkets that suggest another multiverse traveler, or randonaut in our case, has been there and knows that these paths are used to travel between worlds. the priest, father callahan, is being pursued by vampires and ""low-men"" who make up a shadow organization of sorts, to kill him or bend him to their will. i interpret this as a personification of the despair meme. anyway, i thought this connection was really interesting.

first attractor (3.65) - met two cats,2019-05-19,"i just learned about all of this last night. (i have no idea how i even stumbled upon it.) i absolutely love this type of thing. i already periodically did a thing i referred to as ""confusing the timeline,"" where i'd just spent a day doing things as arbitrarily as possible (like a dog, or a bug) in various little ways. and any time i have actually made a very abrupt and objectively odd life choice, it seemed like the universe/everyone around me would start bending over backward to create roadblocks in increasingly forceful ways, and i'd end up back where i started. so i've always been very interested in this idea that there are set paths/*allowed* timeline deviations for every person, and that it is within one's best interest to deviate from them. i know that many would say, ""well why not just act whimsically and do things at random without the help of an app?"" and i try to do that as well, however i don't entirely trust my subconscious mind to produce *truly* random ideas and directions all the time-- ones that will not just lead me right back where i started, in my designated bubble, in a roundabout way that *seems* random or promising at first but it is not. (especially as i am greatly prone to unconscious self-sabotage) &amp;#x200b; anyway, i set the radius to &gt;1000, as i do not have a car. i live in a suburban area. beyond my neighborhood is just pavement and strip malls. generated a 3.65 attractor point about half a mile a way. didn't see anything unusual on the way there (it was just normal neighborhoods), aside from maybe this knocked over tree next to a stop ahead sign (but not actually unusual seeing as there's been lots of storms and knocked down trees lately) : https://i.redd.it/z536s5uc18z21.jpg when i was about two thirds of the way there, google maps kept malfunctioning, which led to me taking a wrong turn. once i was finally almost there (still just in a suburban neighborhood), while passing the house that was right before the attractor point, this black cat appeared out of nowhere, and was walking alongside me about 10 feet away (there were people getting out of a car in the houses's driveway we were passing, but they didn't speak to me; they glanced at me oddly though because i was talking to the cat), and led me right to the destination which was someone's driveway. the cat laid down far up the driveway and kept meowing at me softly. i called to him and he let me pet him (and then another cat appeared, an orange one, who was also very friendly). the house: &amp;#x200b; https://i.redd.it/coujfysa28z21.jpg (the driveway was on the right of it. numerology experts, feel free to tell me what 9424 might signify.) so, nothing out of the ordinary really. i pet stray cats in this area all the time, and am always on the lookout for stray cats and dogs to meet when on one of my normal walks. i'm going to go out again shortly with my friend who has a car, so that we can set a wider radius. will report back later i suppose."

what i saw on my second attractor outing,2019-05-19,"sunday, may 17, 2019 on my way to my second attractor i saw a man riding a double decker bike! i was moving and so was he so i did not get a picture. but how cool to see something like that when im breaking out of my usual routine! it tickled me. when i got there, the location was a marvelous garden around a little cottage which is charming and pretty. there were some pretty orange flowers along the edge. i decided to get out of my car and walk. as i was going, just as i noticed a really cool planter with swans, and wanted to take a picture, i saw a man come out of his house next-door to my attractor location and get in his car. at this point i felt a little sheepish, not nervous or guilty but just dang it why cant i just do this without anybody seeing me. i decided to just look at the swans for the time being and keep walking until the dude in the car pulled away. as i was walking along, a little girl came riding her bike on the sidewalk. dressed all in red and humming a tune! just sweet as can be. i got back to the area where this one planter was, and took a couple of pictures. posted a pic previously but wanted to tell about the double decker bike and the girl. i think this was a really good outing. i feel kind of jolly and a little bit giggly, and refreshed. this has been a very good experience!"

my first randonaut experience,2019-05-21,"so i decided to finally try this out and attempted to walk an attractor chain yesterday, looking for odd occurrences, things trying to block me, etc. overall, it was a pretty non-eventful experience. no attractors over 2.1 or so. nothing much happened at all. a couple i was unable to get to because they were located in a building or in someone's fenced backyard, but i would reset my location and generate a new one and keep going. several were barely over 1.0 and read invalid. never had any despair or felt like anything out of the ordinary was happening. eventually i got bored of it. but the reason i'm posting this at all is because of the very first attractor i received. this is very odd indeed. for those that read my first post from a few days ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/randonauts/comments/bpe0zi/found_this_sub_yesterday_this_morning_had_a/ you remember that i had an odd experience where there were two blonde women both dressed alike with white phones and white vans and at consecutive intersections on my walk to work. i mentioned that there wasn't a third blonde woman but that it was strange enough anyway. my very first attractor received from the fatum bot was a spot on the very next intersection from the second blonde woman, in a continuous line from where they both were standing. i went to the spot. there was nothing there. or... actually, there was a white electric company truck in the middle of the street, working on the power lines. i looked at all the writing and numbers on the truck to see if there were any symbols or odd conditions, but no there weren't. i am bummed that my attractor chain was such a dud. but there is absolutely no denying the strangeness that of all the places the bot could have sent me on my first excursion it sent me to the place that a 3rd blonde woman would have been."

second round- quantum points and more entanglement,2019-05-22,"after my last round of attractor points that led me around a small circle and then the bot conking out, i decided to switch to just quantum points. i figured, if the /getattractor is a cluster of points, maybe specific points would have a stronger message, impact, etc. i slightly increased my radius and did this trip by car. my first point took me to a part of town that i've been passed, but not directly at. as i was driving down the road to the first point, i realized i was heading towards the offices of a company involved in a project i am actively working to block. across from this company's headquaters, there was a union hall- not surprising given the headquarters. i definitely felt like i was in enemy territory (not that i have anything against the union- its just this specific project). further down the road to my point, was this crematorium with this falling apart trolley car in front of it. i also spend a lot of time at work talking about public transportation, so that was also a weird connection. as i came up to my spot, i realized it was inside a national guard training facility. again, very relevant given the project, etc. my next spot was pretty much around the industrial park block, and on a power line right of way. i didn't walk to the actual spot (no proper footware- lesson for next time), but this spot was also down the road from a cop's house (cop car parked in the driveway, like end of the day parked, not i'm here to arrest someone parked). my last spot took me back ""around the block"" and was inside the union hall. all places that, given my current work, i'm very connected to and which it is not entirely out of the realm of possibilities that i could have ended up at under other circumstances. i'm wondering how this fits in with the despair meme, as my relationship with the organizations occupying those spots is adversarial. &amp;#x200b; this all happened two days ago, and tonight i had a pretty extreme emotional response to ""the oa"". i've just binged watched the first season of the show, and there were a few scenes in the last two episodes of the season that had me bust out in full on crying. i've never had that strong of a reaction to a television show, but given the nature of the show and experimenting with this project, i'm not too shocked at it. &amp;#x200b; for anyone that's been doing this for a while, have you found a correlation between your radius and the attractor strength?"

question about quantum physics.,2019-05-27,"i'm curious about a simple thing. so, from what i understood, the fatum bot utilizes numbers coming from a quantum randomizer, in order to escape the laws of cause and effect and generate true ""randomness"". but isn't this randomness simply the starting point of determinism? aren't them the original ""cause""? don't all things come from quantum particles? aren't all the existing things affected by the way quantum particles behave, escalating from them to physics, to life, to consciousness, to behaviour? what makes this an escape from determinism, rather than a shortcut in the process? i admit i am a bit new to all of this, can someone enlighten me?"

probability blind spots,2019-05-27,"blind-spots search blind spots are places that we naturally cannot reach. if you are looking for them close to home, these will be places that you have never noticed before. their search is possible by adding randomness that decreases your determinism. thus, single quantum random points (getquantum) are most suitable for that purpose. a random point does not necessarily lead you to a blind spot, but it can lead you there with a certain probability, while it is almost impossible to find it yourself. the more random points you visit, the higher the probability of finding a blind spot. intention-driven anomalies (attractors) attractors can also lead you to a blind spot, but they were not created for this. the methodology for calculating attractors is based on gcp project research on the influence of consciousness on quantum probability. such points rely not so much on randomness, but on emergent fluctuations in randomness, when random points under the action of intention begin to be distributed unevenly and form anomalous density around the point of application of intention. accordingly, the attractor-point is primarily an anomaly caused by intention. here, the number of visited points is not important, as well as whether the location found is a blind spot or not. here it is important to establish a correlation between what you thoughts and attitude, and what you found in that place or the consequences that resulted from visiting an attractor. in this sense, attractors with high power will meet the greatest influence of intention. invalid attractors, whose power is close to one, have no influence of intention in themselves and, in fact, are simply random points."
"things i encounter in my randonaut outings are reappearing my reality matrix later, in a different form.",2019-05-28,"i have been randonauting for a few weeks now, and i am noticing an interesting pattern. certain objects and symbols i encounter during a randonaut outing tend to keep popping up in the future as i go about my life. here are three examples: 1. i saw a chalk drawing of what looked like a centipede. a week later, i took a mini-vacation to a property my family owns in the country. in the house, i encountered an 8 inch long centipede--the first i have ever seen in real life! it looked like an alien and scared the hell out of me. then i looked up the spiritual/totem meaning of the centipede, and it was very positive (blessings, financial abundance, good luck, etc.). one of the intentions i hold when i have gone on these randonaut journeys is abundance, guidance, and clarity about my path/business. 2. in a neighborhood not far from mine, i saw three giant monk parakeet nests and heard what sounded like a dozen of them squawking. they are not indigenous to my area, but a colony has formed from escaped pets. they are ""out of place"" birds. it really caught my attention! then, this weekend i saw a woman painting a mural of a monk parakeet just a few blocks from my house. i just looked up what parakeets stand for, and one of their characteristics is bringing in divine guidance. 3. the bot took me to church. i consider myself spiritual, but not religious. i haven't been to church in decades. this past weekend, i was invited to a greek festival. i had no idea that it was being held at a greek orthodox church, so i found myself at church again! this time, i did go inside and even lit a candle with my prayers attached to it. just thought i would share, in case others are also noticing a similar phenomenon."

gift from the universe: the rainbow book!,2019-05-29,"my girlfriend and i ate some mushrooms on sunday and wanted to go on a bike ride, and because premeditated destinations are boring, we decided to ""get quantum"" (as we call it) and do an attractor chain. we set our radius to 3000 meters, generated, and got pedaling. not much to note about the first attractor point itself, except that it was next to a park in which [all the signs had been tagged void](https://imgur.com/mgibe3h), so we decided to switch from attractors to voids for the rest of the day, but the real magic was hands down the best artifact i've ever discovered on a fatum trip, and one of the coolest things i've ever found, period. this was discovered in a [""little free library""](https://littlefreelibrary.org/) box next to the void park next to our attractor point. behold! the rainbow book! [https://imgur.com/a/721z5oz](https://imgur.com/a/721z5oz) the book is almost 260 pages and very difficult to photograph, but i snapped a couple on my phone to give you all an idea of the sort of scientific/esoteric information, as well as art and poetry contained within. the book itself was published as a sort of companion piece to a three-month-long art exhibition called the rainbow show that took place at the san francisco fine arts museum in 1975, which explored the rainbow as both symbol and physical phenomenon throughout history. despite its scope, i haven't been able to find much about the show online, and copies of the rainbow book are relatively rare and go for about $50-$200 depending on condition. the binding is pretty messed up on the copy we found, but all the pages are here. if you see something that piques your interest in the contents page, let me know and i'll try to snap those pages for you. also of interest was an additional book in the library called ""waking,"" which i grabbed based on the title alone. i plan on reading the whole thing, but [this page was dogeared and highlighted.](https://imgur.com/6yo762f)"

story time! pft intel report: a random sunday stroll,2019-06-05,"upon reading the beautiful article quantum geomancy (https://sublunar.space/2019-05-quantum-geomancy.html) by one of our dear members, i decided to apply some of their musings and add my own twist to it - i didn't wanted to go too deep into solidifying a potential framework and just see what happens today. my idea was also inspired by my old ingress days and i wanted to take my manifestation work with intentions and affirmations out into the field and play a bit. i tried to keep my plan as simple as possible with as little expectations an enthusiast as i can realistically have. my goal was to pay a visit to five consecutive attractor points within about two hours in total. and i set out an intention for each of the tbd points upfront and planned to leave an energetic stamp for each of the spots accordingly. i had one main hope, tho: that the bot would send me around in a circle. the intentions i decided upon were the following: 1. prosperity 2. protection 3. safety 4. compassion 5. generosity i didn't had full fledged affirmations out for all intentions apart from a general wanting to provide something wholesome to whomever i would encounter, who would be happen to exist around those points i will visit and that i can spread some of my love vibes as i go. the inspiring article mentioned offerings, an idea which i love and instantly resonated with. as a smoker, tobacco made sense but i remembered i had plenty of ""foiferli"" lying around, the smallest swiss coins of five rappen value. i grabbed a handful and decided to gift them to the places i will visit. equipped with some beverages, a battery pack, two bags to clean up and a plastic glove *just in case*, i left my home and pinged the fatum-bot at 10:39h. and at 10:40h. and at 10:44h - until i noticed it might be down so i checked the main randonaut tg group to see whats what xd i didn't figure out how to make ""/getpseudo"" work but found the other bot, randonaut. sent my location again at 10:48h and got the first confirmation. as i hit ""/gettractor"" i closed my eyes and focussed all my attention to my first intention, prosperity. i let my mind come up with thoughts forming positive affirmations around it and when i really felt it, i opened my eyes to check for my first attractor point: 4.43 power. however. since i explore pft by foot, i noticed the radius was too large for my planned endeavour and i didn't feel like walking 3km out of the city to the first point alone, so i set the radius to 1km. i want to remark that because the initial location wouldve changed my route. i repeated the process with a tighter radius and the next attractor point, which was the first i would go visit that day, was 3.29 power. i started to walk. this sunday was a bit cloudy but conveniently warm and no bright sun light - score! it can get very tricky to play mobile device games in spring and summer. i was in a very tlc mood and touched a lot of the beautiful lush green as i walked around, i also stopped at every flower to take a hit of their scent. i silently repeated ""prosperity"" as a mantra to myself and, to be perfectly honest, to not start to think about what i will find at the attractor point. about half-way in, i saw a pretty majestic rose which i sniffled on for a while before continuing my walk when i noticed a children's book lying on the sidewalk right in front of me. i could've sworn it wasn't there before but decided that i must've been too focussed on the rose and simply missed it. it was open on a page showing a farmer in a truck pulling a cow in a wagon and a dog running by their side. the image was trying to be cheerful as it can be in a book for children about farming, but it made me sad to look at it, thinking of all the downsides of industrial farming and i was definitely touchy about it since i am not immune to the concerns many of us share about the health state of planet earth. i left the book on a small stoop to the side and continued to walk when i encountered an e-scooter in the middle of the sidewalk ahead. those are very trendy and apparently you can leave them anywhere you want when you're done driving for someone else to take over. my first thought was to consider it as a sign to visit the further point with some mobility support and pondered for a second to try install the app required to use these thingies and continue with it, then decided it seemed too procrastination-y and i continue my walk (even though it had a convenient little smartphone holder xd). i noticed a sticker on a lamppost right in front of me that said ""car-free zurich"" which i found very appropriate for my mood. next time, then. as i continued i repeated my intention. i was getting closer to my first attractor which was in the building of a large swiss bank. lol. nice."", i thought. i did my best to not get enthused over the coincidence and noticed my attractor was inside the corporate building where i couldn't reach it and ended up about 8m apart. i scanned the environment if i would find any ""artifacts"" while collecting trash left and right and found few transaction slips of cash people pulled from the atm outside of the building. the largest amount was chf 1000 and it really makes you wonder who pulls so much cash out on a saturday afternoon xd. i ended up finding exactly five receipts and packed them as my artifacts of that spot. i sat down in front of the building and whipped out my coin purse. i had an intuition that, if i happen to have packed enough, i could leave five foiferli at each spot just for giggles and started counting - and ended up with exactly 25 coins. one of them was another currency that looked very similar so it's not cheating, they're about equally worthless. i laughed out loud. another lovely coincidence. i started to think about the many ways a bank can help people around prosperity in a very hands-on way, and fuelled my intentions with positive affirmations; for the employees who enter and leave this building on a regular, for all customers with wholesome plans that they would get the credits they require, that such a big bank can also become a helper in people of need vs just havin toxic and abusive business models. my final affirmation as i was holding my handful of coins to my heart space was around the following thoughts: **1. prosperity** *may our challenges in life around lack of funds be overcome. may anyone required to stay in an unhealthy bond out of existential need become free and may anyone abused by others for security be relieved from their burden.* i dropped the coins into slits i found on the side of the building. i pinged the bot for my second location and repeated the procedure from my first attractor grab. next attractor was 2.45 and while ""low power"" i didn't mind and was really excited to go on. as i started to walk towards my second attractor point i repeated my second intention, protection, and mentally tied it to my first intention and corresponding affirmation. on my way i noticed some placards for a save-the-glacier initiative currently running. i didn't think much of it. and again around half-way in i noticed a ridiculously huge message on the wall of a stadium that said ""geh nach hause"" which is german for go home. a slight discomfort started to come up and a mild paranoia around a silly fear i have sometimes. i remembered remarks and comments around ""despair meme"" and wondered: was what the guys would talk about? i did think for a hot second whether i want to call the experiment off and consider the message ""a warning"", just to realize what i am doing here, as silly as it may be to anybody, meant a lot to me and that what i was experiencing was my self-doubt. if there was any malevolence occurring then and there to keep me from doing it must be because what i am doing is totally working! rationalization ftw. so i continued, now starting to pick up litter as i walk. lots of fives, from numbers on papers to number of empty beverage cans. i love my positive confirmation bias. i reached my second point which was again bank but one with a slightly better reputation as a cooperative driven one. again the attractor point was not accessible but i got as close to it as i could from outside (about 6m distance). my intention for this attractor point was protection. i repeated my little bootleg ritual from the first visit and the affirmation i came up with sounded about as follows: **2. protection** *may we all be nurtured and have shelter, may we all be protected in whatever way we require it in our lives. may we all live a prosperous life.* this place was cleaner than the first but i did found a paper which turned out to be a voucher :d i also saw a beautiful gathering of some flora in the vicinity that i snapped a photo of because it looked really nice. after i dropped my offerings, i took out my phone to identify my next spot to go to. after a 2km more or less straight line it sent me in a direction back which was the route i wanted to go. 4.18 power. i felt as if my hope for a circle was coming together very nicely. it was here that i started to realize how good it felt to connect the intentions to each other and as i moved on to my third spot, i would repeat my third intention for safety while also keeping the first ones in mind on loop. in the context of the places i visited up to here it felt very appropriate since money and funds are crucial elements to our economical world views as well as challenges. on my way to the next stop i came closer to my own ""piss bottle"" experience than i hoped i would. it isn't a phaenomena around our parts here since public urinating isn't punished as hard as in other parts and also we don't sit long enough in automobiles to justify such behaviour? i think? so i found a bottle of apple juice which i still think was ""just"" apple juice but i touched it with a glove only nonetheless. tho the corner where the bottle was standing around was most definitely a regular pee corner, the scent surrounding that spot was very giving away. my third spot was the branch of one of the world leading houses for audit/assurance/consulting/tax services and again inside the building. i got as close to about 5m to it. i felt very much like ""really, from all the possible places these are the ones i am visiting"" - i was amazed, surprised and found it hilarious. that company has plenty of opportunity to give and provide safety and the affirmation around my intentions were to fuel their hearts with wholesome intentions. they may be evil and greedy companies but we all can change our behavioural patterns. all of us, including each and every employee up to the board of directors and shareholders etc., right? so here we go: **3. safety** *may we all feel safe, may we all become free of fear of our lives being in danger, may we all be protected and prosper in life.* when i dropped the five coins for this place, i noticed a missed opportunity that i will be carrying out next time which is to amplify each and every coins' power via mentally fuelling each intention as a sequence for the five coins at each place. i'll see. from the litter i collected and moved to the trash bin, i kept a small green shard of glass as token. on i went to the fourth place. i was really curious to see where it would led me and i almost gagged when i saw it sent me right towards my home, the circle movement got real. the bot didn't respond until i sent my location for the fourth time for a 2.73 power attractor. i moved on and started to feel hungry. i noticed i was out for two hours already and started to feel a little bit tired and really didn't wanted to let all of that mess with my vibes but it did. it was a good reminder to be open to all the possibilities which can occur and be prepared. i started to feel i was going really unprofessional hood witch about all of this and had a good old chuckle with myself. point number four was in a private apartment complex. interesting for me was that the point was within the residential area which is open for visitors but guess what, i just happened to never walk through that specific part. duh. in fact i didn't even realize the area could be accessed the way i ended up leaving because i entered it through the most complicated possible way through bushes and what not - mentioned tiredness had me somehow become a tad lazy and instead of walking detours and have it convenient i started to rush a bit, admittedly. as a consolation i encountered a beautiful black kitteh living there who cuddled with me for a few minutes. i ended up in front of the entry to a couple's home and sat exactly on the attractor point this time. all the apartments had huge doors with walls so nobody saw me sitting in front of that entry like the creep i was did. hue. i performed my ritual and came up with the following affirmation: **4. compassion** *may we all be compassionate towards our own self as well as towards everyone else; may we see those in need and extend our love and kindness. may we all wish for prosperity, protection and safety for every being on this planet.* the only litter i found was a found a folded page from a newspaper about the importance of bees and insects to our biosphere. i took it with me as my reminder to focus my attention on the betterment of our environment which is so full of beauty and grace. time to hit my last spot, number five. all things considered, i loved my adventure and really wished i wasn't experiencing that feeling of a rush i started to have, which i feel was reflected in my last journey bit. i was undecided as to whether i want to interrupt my quest and go home for a food break but that didn't feel right, and i was too low on cash to eat some take out. i decided to stay and visit my fifth spot while taking notes of what i might do differently next time around. of course the bot suddenly suggested yet another 3km distant spot in the neighborhood of the village where my very initial location was at, the one i didn't wanted to visit this time around xd so instead of going home chance wouldve sent me far out and not circular at all. i pinged for a second spot and got a 1.87 attractor point further - weak like me nevertheless meaningful, we know that all spots are worth a visit. i walked uphill towards my fifth spot while repeating all five intentions and the corresponding affirmations to myself. i passed beautiful places and encountered two more save-the-glaciers posts along my way. i remembered seeing it earlier and felt that if it would be very nice if we could fuel some funds into that initiative. i reached my fifth spot which was another apartment complex and the attractor in one of the apartments, this time there were a lot of people around outside. i didn't break a sweat as i knew weve all seen more weird things than a person lingering around buildings looking at their smartphone but i mightve gotten some looks as i dropped my coins after my affirmation setting. anyhoo, i focussed my attention on my last intent and the words that came up were: **5. generosity** *may we all love and share; may we all help and support each other in our needs. may we all prosper in life, may we all be protected and safe, may we all be generous on a material as well as metaphysical level.* happily to have pulled through with it i started to walk back towards home. my circle came to fruition but not purely by chance however close enough for me to have truly enjoyed it, together with all the small positive moments i experienced. there were two chain of events that wouldve changed my overall trip and it was a good learning lesson for next time around. as i was walking home repeating all my five intentions with their affirmations, i heard the bell ring twice. i felt an impulse to search for another meaningful sign but realized its only 2pm and not 5pm or the like - but guess what, in my parts its 14:00h so ill take it for my 5 bias &lt;3 at that point i allowed myself to let my thoughts wander for a while as well as going back and forth to repeating my intentions. and i found a lottery ticket, still need to check if i might've won something. i went very improv about all of this and by the time i got home i allowed myself to process all of my impressions and notice where and how i would do things differently on my next run while i was cooking something. for example repeating one of the intentions for every coin i drop, stay longer for a meditation session on every location, not leave the house on an empty stomach, be open to the idea of using transportation in some form while playing. and bring more trash bags, geez. that was a lot of fun to do and i hope i will be able to bring people with me to amplify the power of intentions and manifestations, as well as to combine our energies over time. usually my private manifestation work is around my own life and it was important to me to do this exclusively for everybody but me and think of as many beings' well-being as possible while doing this experiment. it may be more difficult to observe direct and immediate impact some action may potentially have if we do it more wide spread like that but who knows, maybe the companies i visited will become more active in preserving our environment and maybe each and every one who passes there, works and lives, might have received a little love boost and may pass some good vibes on etc. i added a modest bathing ritual as a closure to my ritual, i poured all love i could summon into the water and released it into the grounds, fuelling the stamps of my visited points, my intentions and affirmations that i spread along my adventure. tl;dr as little as i alone may be able to contribute to all of our betterment, it isn't relevant for me to know whether i have an impact or not, what is important is that we all make this beautiful life on this planet work out for all of us together with lots and lots of love. and i had a great time outdoors with many funny, ridiculous moments of joy and bliss and that's the beauty of randonauts to me. so worth it &lt;3 [pics ](https://imgur.com/a/bgy66ua)"

void psychosis,2019-06-05,"i just read about you guys today, glad to be here, i just want to share my testimony which is basically that in december of 2007 while messing with some mind body shit, i ended up in a state such that my cause and effect warp tunnel collapsed and my mind was crushed. any action i took or thought was outside any probably course so i was literally trapped in void state. it took me about half a year to recover to where i could start working again but from that point onward i had the despair meme you're taking about except it was applied to most anything beyond my immediate reality. i spent several years where i couldn't do things even like walk once around my subdivision without like short circuiting it's hard to describe or like if i went to a store an invisible force prevented me from going back in unless i really had a purpose to be there. even writing this here my phone is starting to fuck up so i'll make this short. after about eight years i found a person who could access this void state through mediation and basically create his own probability tunnels and determine what things would stand out to him. he showed me basically what you guys are saying and like splinted me back into reality. i just wanted to post this here to let you know this is factually correct for anyone wondering and that it can be accessed scientifically and also through mental disciplines"

clustered locations,2019-06-06,"i have noticed an occurrence when using the bot. the first time i was aware of it was about two weeks ago when my first attractor of the day was on the train tracks, knowing i couldn't access the area i quickly hit the bot up for another, it was again on the tracks about 20 metres south, and the third time it was further along and into the sidings. in my head i thought. 'oh wow, the attractor is a train' so quickly hit up the bot again, but sadly no more trackside locations. yesterday i had a similar occurrence which seemed like a movement in and around a crematorium. which i couldn't visit as it has a strict no dog policy and i had mine with me. the first one was a 9.11 and the further two much lower around the crematorium grounds and then nothing. this time i thought, yup 'attractors a ghost!' i wondered if anyone else had some interesting clusters when hitting up the bot for locations in quick succession. anyway, if nothing else it's made me pay more attention to the locations in relation to each other and certain patterns. just wish i had not cleared my chats so hastily."

just got back from my first journey within 1k of my house,2019-06-06,"i learned about fatum yesterday and decided that if i had the time today i'd try my first walking 1k journey starting from where i live. i did three attractors in a row, resetting my location each time. all took me to alley locations. the first was a parking lot behind a seniors' home a few blocks away. i didn't notice anything out of the ordinary, so i reset and got another attractor. first attempted gave me a low-power one, but the second was strong. it was a good four blocks away from my home again, but in pretty much the opposite direction. so i walked like eight blocks this time. another alley, but the pin was actually in the alley. the exact location was just some furniture tossed out. a few houses down there was a guy working to unload some stuff from his pickup truck to a house that was under construction. i reset my location again and got the last attractor. the pin ended up on the same house under construction, so only like 30m away in the same alley. i found that pretty interesting considering that the area of a circle with a 1k radius is pretty big. i decided i didn't want to get any closer than i was, since i figured it would appear suspicious to the guy. i then walked back home. my first thought about this little test experience is the small interactions i had while going to my destinations. i smiled and said hi to a few people walking their dogs. if i hadn't performed this little experiment there probably would have been no one there at that location and time. although however small, i changed their lives randomly. i kept thinking while walking, i normally shouldn't be here but here i am. i plan to do a larger 5k driving session soon and will post my experience."

"just found this sub, and this idea... and i love it",2019-06-06,"hello fellow randonauts! i'm a noob here, i just found the sub yesterday. and i must say, it deeply deeply piques my curiosity!!!!! seriously... i haven't been this excited about something on the internet in a very long time. &amp;#x200b; (sorry bortposting! yer great, but yer not quantum mechanic-al). &amp;#x200b; i went on my first attractor adventure yesterday. it didn't lead me to any particularly odd or exciting experience, it just lead me to a house in my neighborhood. the plot point was definitely inside the house, a private residence, so i couldn't investigate further. i wish i could, though... i mean, oh my gawd, what is in that house?!? &amp;#x200b; i will l be doing more attractor point adventures in the next few weeks. i'm going to try bigger and bigger radiuses, and try for a multi-point adventure soon, too. &amp;#x200b; but you know, i partially just want to tell y'all how happy this makes me. &amp;#x200b; i guess i've always been interested (sometimes even anxious) about how the ins &amp; outs quantum physics intersects with our lived experiences. like, for instance, what i like to call ""the path or fate"". basically, it's the ""path"" that we are all personally &amp; individually going along as we live our lives, each of us uniquely informed by all our individual past experiences &amp; past knowledge bases, all of which work in concert to inform any given current decision in our lives... as we move along ""the path"". &amp;#x200b; in this way, it could be argued that all or our decisions are mainly informed from our past experiences, over-layed on any given current situation... and what this means that we all kinda only have a small handful of options about ""what to do"" in any given moment or circumstance... because that sense of ""what to do"" will always be informed by our past experience (""what happened before...""), which we cannot directly change. in other words, it could be said that the ""path"" is sort -of laid out in front of you already; you just haven't gone down it yet. &amp;#x200b; it gets deeper when you consider that any given decision could lead you down any number of multiple paths with any number of multiple outcomes. but... the actual variety of those different paths becomes diminished as time goes on. as your experiences in life pile up, as you become an ""individual""... the one path that makes the most sense for our ""selves"" starts to be the one we choose more &amp; more often. and even if we make wildly different choices from time to time, disrupting whatever path we may have been going along, even the amount of options in the 'wildly different"" category becomes a lot less as we get older... again, mostly informed by our decisions in the past. &amp;#x200b; a question arises... is there any way to get beyond our personal path? are we ""fated"" to be on it, moving along it, each new day always &amp; forever informed by our lived experience that came before? how does one truly deviate, truly experience something... different?! the fatum project seems to be specifically oriented towards disrupting that path... just for the sake of doing so. i absolutely love concept of the project. merely walking over to the first attractor point filled me with such a strong sense of pleasure &amp; contentment that i was genuinely surprised. it just felt good. i'm stoked to go on more random adventures, and i will report back as often as i can. &amp;#x200b; all this making me wonder... how did i ""decide"" to ""randomly"" surf around yesterday and stumble upon this sub? &amp;#x200b; ;) &amp;#x200b; many, many thanks to all those who have worked to this project, and specifically to the folks who created the bot, which made the concept easy to try out. and, to all the randonauts that have decided to spin the wheel of chance in their lives... i love you all for your intrepid spirit of adventure!! &amp;#x200b; let's get random."

"my hypothesis, my bias, about what might be going on here",2019-06-06,"hi everyone, i was encouraged to post my hypothesis in its own post here, feel free to share your thoughts! ill try to keep it as short as possible. first of all, i come to this with a bit of a spiritual perspective. i mean that in the sense that consciousness isnt just bound to this reality, but that this reality is just a thing our consciousness is doing/experiencing, for various reasons, and that theres a higher/greater reality that were really a part of. that this world is basically just a video game, and we forget that while were here, but through exploring and our consciousness we can bump up against our greater reality. some people call it spirituality, some people think of it as a computer simulation, a matrix, a world of magic, a religious thing, a mathematical thing, whatever. i think the differences are mostly semantics and finding concepts we can understand to roughly approximate the little bit we know about a greater reality that we cant/dont understand. were like jellyfish trying to talk to other jellyfish in the ocean about what bob and maria in accounting in kansas city are up to. the context just isnt really there. but i call it spirituality, so there ya go. so i think its possible that the reason this project seems to generate a lot of meaningful coincidences, synchronicities, is because instead of being truly random (though it is that in our physical matrix world) its actually able to be the opposite of random-meaningful and connected to our personal consiouness and intentions, and is in a very real way a communication with our greater reality. communication facilitated by the very fact that the experiment does take you off the rails of your entrenched patterns of everyday life. lots of people have experienced meaningful coincidences in their life, theres no one right way for someone to connect with your higher self/other beings beyond the veil/god/whatever the communication is, but this project seems to make it easier for those beings/the universe/your higher self (i put it this way because i really dont know the answer) to manifest these messages to you. to more easily direct you to a message instead of trying to shove one into your normal pattern where you arent usually looking. or maybe the messages are always there and this just forces you to only see the message, not the daily clutter of your mind. i dont know. but to me this project is about meaning, since im coming to it with my own belief system and bias that i think life itself is about meaning. i feel like ive had the universe communicating with me in different forms for a while, just as a quiet, subtle thing, and this falls right in line with that for me so far. hopefully what im trying to say is clear enough, and of course i dont expect that everyone agrees, nor do i insist im right, its just an idea, maybe a jumping off point for other ideas. thanks for reading!"
stone circle &amp; kaos magic - first randonaut report,2019-06-06,"hey everybody, i just found this subreddit last night from nickhintonn333's post on /r/glitch_in_the_matrix/ and thought i'd try it out. &amp;#x200b; [accompanying photos](https://imgur.com/a/y3cd2a3) &amp;#x200b; i'm in mendoza, argentina. i've been here for about two weeks. so it was funny to find that when i asked the bot for coordinates, it gave me an area that i already know quite well - a place around the corner from a vegetarian restaurant i've been to 5 times, and a couple of doors up from a stationary store where i bought a notebook. attractor power 1.73. i had a look around, trying not to look like too much of a weirdo, looking for objects or anything. i didn't notice anything unusual. on the way, i did see a beaten up car, with the back seat stuffed floor to ceiling with old newspapers... might be weird in australia, but not in latin america. &amp;#x200b; i asked the bot for another location. again, it sent me to a place i already knew, the plaza of independence, power 5.18. i got to the north eastern corner. i noticed how beautiful it looked, the little drain or canal with running water next to the footpath, the old fashioned lamp post, the trees. on the grass, about fifteen metres from the map location, there was a little ditch with some of a tree stump on the side, and several stones in a circle, about 20cm across. too small to make a fireplace, yet very deliberately placed. i took one of the stones, a piece of some kind of false marble from a tile. &amp;#x200b; i took a seat on a nearby bench. i started to feel a little uncomfortable, as i noticed there was a man watching me from another bench, probably wondering why i was acting so curiously, as if i were looking for something lost but didn't know what it was. i also felt uncomfortable, having taken an artifact and not having offered something in return. i picked up a leaf and thought some kind thoughts, and put it in the stone circle. &amp;#x200b; on the concrete fence at the corner of the park, i found a graffiti, a black tag ""kaos"", and a symbol which looked a lot like the symbol for chaos magick. how about that... &amp;#x200b; the third location was across from the plaza de italia, outside a restaurant. nearby there was a pole with some sticker art saying ""lsd"" and ""lo pandito"" or ""the shallow"". across the road from the attractor location was a children's playground, with tape around it saying ""peligro"" or ""danger"". other than that, there was nothing peculiar except that the park is again very beautiful, with sculptures dedicated to notable italian argentines, and of romulus and remus with the she-wolf. &amp;#x200b; i didn't feel the despair, except for a little discomfort when that man was looking at me. on the contrary, i felt a little high, like i'd taken a microdose of something, looking all around me for interesting things. next time i'll set the radius higher, putting me in places which i definitely wouldn't walk to. it seems common to get to a place and see someone waiting. in the future, i'll probably try to start some conversations, as it's an easy way to interact with the environment. &amp;#x200b; thank you and happy randonauting"

so much resistance just starting the fatum project/trying to be a randonaut,2019-06-07,"fell down this rabbit hole this week. wanted to try a randonaut experience but seems i'm running in to *a lot* of resistance even trying to begin. they are all small coincidences but add up - here are some of the examples so far; while reading into it and getting some good understand i'm always interrupted. my colleagues don't usually talk to me but whenever i've been reading about this they've been wittering on no end about nothing in particular, not even work related. also two have gone off sick and my workload has increased since trying to get into this, making it more difficult. was going to do the following yesterday evening but my father-in-law called and needed us urgently round his house. his freezer broke down and he needed my help moving it to the garage and dragging a backup in. got back super late, had takeaway and got distracted. this morning, telegram app wouldn't install on my device, i cleared cache, restarted and everything and it still wouldn't install. so i went to push install it through pc instead. this is interesting because less than 10 minutes before i had installed another app, and then when i clicked telegram it asked me to login. it didn't ask me to log in at all to do the first app. lastpass also didn't populate the login like it *always* does. i had to manually type it in, twice because it didn't recognise password first time, all while a colleague who doesn't usually talk to me was distracting me again. i need to stress that these people maybe spend 2 minutes a week usually talking to me, about work stuff. yesterday and today it's been endless talking about nothing. i don't have a good memory so i wanted to jot this down so i didn't forget before typing it out, and again, someone who never talks to me came in and started telling me about his weekend plans. i never talk to this guy and i didn't ask. i get they are all innocent coincidences but together it adds up to quite a bit of resistance to what should have been an easy 2 minute task. looking forward to my experience and to see if more, and greater, resistance happens closer to the actual attractor point"
"i want to believe, but..",2019-06-07,"this kind of seems like a magnet for schizophrenic people. i feel like fucking russell crowe dropping reports in some random estate's mailbox. as someone who has recovered from a solid decade of paranoid delusions (alex jones, et all), i'm reluctant to jump down another rabbit hole. i was raised super christian, so i understand the desire to find deeper meaning and synchronicity, but at the end of the day isn't it all just horse shit? i totally have a penchant for this kind of thinking. if i found out about this years ago, i'd probably have been commited by a concerned family member. all quantum jargon aside, this is nothing more than a system to get people to go to random places and possibly entertain a logical fallacy along the way, right?"
scary occurrences after reading randonaut posts,2019-06-07,"this may not sound like a big deal to yall, but i am a very paranoid person so its a huge deal to me. some of you have been wandering if life changes happen after simply reading about these randonaut stories. well, i read hours of them last night and theres been definite changes in my life today in a way that taunts my worst fears. im the type of person where if i hear the slightest movement in the house, ill be up for hours thinking someone could be inside. saying this, i am very aware of sounds and whats the norm. well, tonight was definitely not the norm. it started with a huge bang. i had no idea where it came from and i have never once heard a bang that loud in my apartment complex, ever. after that i hear someone walking around outside (its 2:00am). the latest ive heard someone walking around at night is 12:00am and its always just them walking to or from their car. this person seemed to be walking around aimlessly. which has never once happened in my apartment complex. next, i hear some alarm go off. i stay frozen in my bed for about 30 minutes and call my fianc to help me build up the nerve to get out and check it out (im literally crying as i open my bedroom door- this is all very intense for my already over-paranoid self). i discover its my carbon monoxide alarm and grab my bird and get out of there as fast as possible to drive to my fiancs. upon further research, it could have been an alarm telling me to replace the thing but we dont know for sure because different sites say different things for different years of my model and we cant find the manual for my specific detecter. carbon monoxide or not, i have never had this happen before and even if it was a normal occurrence like a dying battery, it was just ridiculous for my sake that it had to happen exactly while all this other stuff was happening. i literally thought my neighbor was dropping a carbon monoxide bomb in my house.... or someone broke into my apartment and was playing a fake alarm to get me to come out of my room. so im at my fiancs and i have to have the glass door open to cool down the room for my bird when i hear a literal man in isaiahs yard. i realized he was just trying to get his dog, but this is the first time this has ever happened and again - i know this doesnt sound like a big deal to a normal person, but for me it is a very big and terrifying deal. it is a total event for me for a stranger to be within my private property bubble for whatever reason. so its just crazy that all these first time occurrences that are a very big deal for me all happened after i read randonaut posts."

an animal filled attractor chain trip!,2019-06-07,"hello! i might be addicted to this now. i did a chain of attractors today. my first trip, yesterday, lead me to a statue of st francis, the saint of animals. both yesterday and today ive held intentions of peace, calm, and releasing anxiety (which i always have.) now, i have a hard time using imgur on my phone so heres a contextless album thats out of order: https://m.imgur.com/a/irwqlol brief descriptions of each spot: first stop was a house with a gray cat in the driveway, who came up and cuddled with me for a while. i really felt the anxiety melt away and felt very relaxed after this encounter. between the first and second stop i had a quick work meeting, so i guess the actual chain starts here. the second stop was just another nice neighborhood house with a curious squirrel that ran out in front of me and up a tree to stare at me for what seemed like longer than these skiddish little guys usually seem to. was surprised i could take lots of pics of him staring at me. third stop had the dot right on a dog poop scoop sign with a cartoon dog on it. an interesting little apartment complex id never seen before, in a style i havent really seen in my town before, in an area i pass by a lot, so that was neat. fourth stop was in front of another house, with another cat in the driveway! i didnt get out of my car at this one because i saw people going in the house, i felt like a creeper haha. regret that now though. last stop was at a house with a car in the driveway that said god and holy, and i talked to the owner a bit, an older man. tried to explain what i was doing without getting too into it, just that i was working on a project where i visit random points in my neighborhood and take pics. he told me blessings as i left. i also got a couple lottery tickets on my way home cause fuck it, why not, saw ones with a cat on em, and won $4 haha. (i was telling myself in my head i was going to win 4 digits.) so, i dont know what the hell! i do feel neutral and un-anxious which is nice. not sure why all the animal encounters, it seems to be the major theme for me, along with christian imagery. im definitely getting into this now, if nothing else this feels like a great meditation tool, forcing you to take notice of your surroundings and appreciate little things, discover little oddities."

"updated faq to address ""the matrix"" meme",2019-06-08,"### are you trying to break out of the matrix? using the matrix metaphor is an oversimplification of fatum theory. strictly speaking the nature of the experiment is not based in matrix/simulation theory, but we can't really say its not true, because it depends on how you define ""the matrix."" if you call the stasis field a matrix, it will be correct, that we are kind of hacking it. the stasis field is not some sort of fake reality, its just a pattern, that limits the available frame of observable reality to the sets of predetermined outcomes. fatum project is an attempt to expand that available frame of reality as much as possible by introducing randomness to holistic patterns. and intention-driven anomalies search via attractor points gives us an opportunity to exploit emergent fluctuations in randomness and their unique properties for the same goal. &amp;#x200b; [https://old.reddit.com/r/randonauts/wiki/faq](https://old.reddit.com/r/randonauts/wiki/faq) &amp;#x200b; i encourage everyone to read the faq and theory page remember when neo flew off and said the matrix is a chrysalis?"

revisiting first attractor,2019-06-09,"my first attractor was back at the start of april. i remember being intrigued because on the map it had the house number as 88. this is a recurring number for me, so much so that i have it on a cap. anyhow, on arriving i found that the actual house was 89a. so i left it at that and thought no more of it. today i was walking past the entrance to the street and felt a pull to go back, so i took the diversion back to the first attractor and stood looking at 89 a. i switched the numbers to their corresponding numerical values and got ""hi a"" my first name initial is a. i also realized i could subtract a/1 from 89 and get 88. it's just a small personal sync or riddle i took from the experience for those into those kinda of things. it was also a reminder to me that there's plenty of details and personal meanings to be derived from even the most seemingly uninspiring places. and yeah, recheck your attractors."

kinda creepy!,2019-06-10,"went for a late night walk with my friend, as we are walking and talking i start telling her about this project and we decide to find an attractor. a little back story on my friend. she is an artist and for quite a while specialized in portraits. at one point she was working on a project where she would paint portraits for the families of children who had passed away. as we turn onto a street she says i think this is the street where that little girl died i am immediately kind of freaked out and ask her what she is talking about. it seems that several years ago, a little girl was abducted from a nearby school, brought to a house in this neighborhood and murdered . as we get closer to the attractor it becomes clear that the point is going to be in the farthest back portion of someones front yard, and she says oh its on the other side of the street im still not exactly following what she means,so we walk to the end of the block and up the street so that we are on the other side of the attractor and there is a small beautiful little pocket park, lots of flowers, benches and a little free library. she then proceeds to tell me that the house that used to be where this park is was the scene of that horrible crime! it was dozed down and the park put there in remembrance of the little girl, and she had painted a portrait for the little girls family after her death. i didnt get a pic because it was so dark, but i will go back tomorrow and get one if anyone is interested."

tech support? i set my radius to 1000m but fatum-bot gives me attractors 142km away,2019-06-10,"as title - i got into this last week and tried this weekend. first getattractor gave me an address in battersea, 142km away. so i ensured my radius was set to 1000m and tried again; second attractor point was in soho... 142km away. could i be doing something wrong, or does the bot only give points in london? &amp;#x200b; if anyone remembers me from friday, my cat seems fine. we think she fell awkwardly and hurt herself but nothing is broken and she's walking on her leg now."
"generated an attractor last night that i didn't visit, then unintentionally realized i went to it 1st thing this morning!",2019-06-10,"hey guys - so this was just kind of fun. i just joined the telegram last night and was messing around generating attractors within various radii (note to the mods that the regular bot wasn't working, so i used shangrila). i generated 5 or 6, none of which i went to because it was kind of late, and the radii for a couple were pretty large. so this morning i had an exercise class scheduled and wanted to grab some coffee before going because i didn't have any in the house. i happened to pick a coffee shop within walking distance that i hadn't ever been to before. it was at this nice little plaza area that i've noticed a bunch and walked past before, but it wasn't until i got there that i realized it was next to an einstein's bagels, which was where one of the attractors was! this was notably the only attractor that i actually remembered the location of, which was kind of interesting - i zoomed in on the map for this one more so than for the others, i guess? was cool to see that i ended up voluntarily and unconsciously going there first thing today! at the specific attractor spot, there was this adorable dog. i tried to take a picture of the dog covertly (it was with its owner), but couldn't really pull it off, so i took some pictures of the flowers around instead. :) i went to my class and walked back to the spot after, and there was another adorable dog in the exact same spot where the attractor specifically led. i really want to get a dog, and plan to do so as soon as i move into a new apartment in the next few weeks. anyway, was just kind of interesting to me to experience this without even consciously intending to travel to the attractor point itself. :)"

awesome example of the theory behind this sub: my first attractor(s),2019-06-10,"yesterday a friend of mine and i generated 4 attactors back to back, the first two of which had a radius of 1000 m and the final two 10,000 m. we were sent to a wooded area, a picnic table, a water treatment plant, then finally a regular house. none of the places seemed very important but we were happy to have introduced some randomness into our lives. a couple hours later, however, i went to the grocery store to buy something and happened to run into my representative in the us house of representatives. we spoke for a moment before i purchased my item and left. reflecting on this event, i realize that each of the attractors and how long it took to reach each one led me directly on the path to meeting this important political figure. since i was only going into the store for a moment, a second more or less spent travelling earlier in the day would have prevented me from running into this person. i thought that this instance was a wonderful illustration of the theory behind what we are all doing with the fatum project. though i dont expect to see other interesting encounters, i am looking forward to making more random forays into my city :-)"

my first attractor. kinda weird.,2019-06-11,"so today i decided to try it and genereted a attractor. it pointed to the back alley i kinda knew but i have never been there. it was some where i always passed by but didnt bother to check as i had no reason to go in there. so today decided to check it out. as i went there and walked further up, i first saw a guy with vitiligo(skin condition) by his cab just chilling in the shade of tree. i work on a store and just this morning had a costumer with same skin condition on his hand. anyway i took right turn as pointed on the map and start to walk and its a dead end. only buildings all around me. at the end of the road, where the attractor was, i see back of a building and it felt weird because i recognize this building. on my way to work i mostly take a route where i see this house. i always look at it and say to my self thats a beautiful house, i wish i had a house like that...yada yada you know just dreaming"". just yesterday i passed by this house and admired it. anyway i found it weird that my first attractor would led me to the back of the house that i have been thinking of."

my first experience was awesome,2019-06-11,"on the way to my first point, fianc and i came across this amazingly fluffy caterpillar with antennas- weve never seen a caterpillar with such long antennas before!! we also saw two cars next to each other at a stoplight with funny license plate text. i dont remember what they said, but thought it against the odds since i hardly see creative license plates. our first point brought us to some broken glass in a parking lot that must have came from a car window - probably a lot of emotion from that event altering the quantum points. before plugging in our next point, we decide to follow a nearby sign to a garage sale and it turned out to be someone we knew from fiancs work. we go to our second point and theres a matrix edition car and another car with the license plate muleluv. lol we have to go home before going to our third point to drop off my bird, but on the way there we see a car that said gwcode3. i dont know what gw is, but code3 psyched me out because i noticed its a thing in the randonaut community to come across the number 3. we drop off my bird and head out to our third point, and on the way we see the code3 car again. the third point was the best one. on the way to it, we found a sign that said healthy lifestyle choice and a backpack with someones belongings, including their id and anti-psychotic meds... we now plan to deliver her backpack to her house. exactly at the point, we spot a golf club with the end of it stuck in a river stream. we pull it out... you know, expecting a normal golf club... and theres a freaking sock covering the club with a goofy, toy monkey tied against it. it was such a fun experience that made me feel like a kid again. no despair meme, but there were a couple aggressors in the form of two different cars almost crashing into us from the other lane."
my trips,2019-06-11,"i want to post all my journeys even if theyre uneventful because i read someone comment on here that they want this subreddit to reflect reality with randonauting so they can get some good data. trip #2: the power was 6.something and it took us to this beautiful area with the huge type of dandelions that i havent seen in years. the actual point was in someones yard between two trees and we couldnt get a good look because they had a lot of gated land :/ however, we did discover and incredibly cute white, fluffy bug that ive only ever seen in pictures. trip #3: went with fianc, my dad, and stepmom. first point took us near to my uncle davids house with whom we havent spoken to in years. i didnt even know he lived in my area. at the exact point, the address number was 3000 (again with the notorious randonaut 3-pattern). second point took us to a house that had some symbols on their car, but we didnt get a good chance to look what they were because someone was standing by the window, staring at us with all the lights off in their house lmao the third point appeared on the map to be in the forest. however, when we arrived near it, there was a random bike trail. seriously random. it was a really short bike trail whos only purpose seemed to lead to this off-the-path manmade trail... which lead directly to the point which happened to be a tiny bridge in the middle of the forest. i just knew there had to be something under the bridge, but we couldnt check it out because the terrain to get to it was too steep for our shoes (really just too steep for my old-ass dads standards lol) and because there was a sign saying we couldnt enter!!! what even is the point of the worlds smallest bike trail and manmade path then."

anything to a bird pattern? my first attractor story &amp; some thoughts/questions.,2019-06-11,"my first attratctor led me to a road i've passed a hundred times, if not more, and never considered, but has since visiting has been a favorite shortcut between towns in my area &amp; so far has been totally empty in each case which is only relevant as i generally avoid people finding it re-energizing to be on my own. i had a plan to visit the local hardware store, but want to try this thing out - so i took my dog to the park, in the opposite direction of the store. they're about 3 miles apart, but at any rate, in the parking lot, i decided to generate an attractor after updating my location. i can't recall the specific power, but have the screenshot to reference if that matters. at any rate, after having driven from my home, away from the store and towards the park, the attractor placed me on a road, about 1/2 mile from the store, and an unmaintained gravel one at that! perfect for a quiet walk with the pup, and conveniently placed me nearby my end goal of the store. happy coincidence? sure. as i walked down the road, i felt quite surprised that i'd never ventured down it in the past, and the photographer in my became excited as i discovered a long desired but never found subject of interest for my personal photography. not only that, but the overall area is too perfect for a variety of photographic uses. again, thrilled about that, i continued onto the point &amp; behold, a red winged black bird sitting about 150 feet from the road in the middle of the field who seemed perplexed by me and began to follow! on the way back, i decided to take video because i as astounded that the bird followed me for about an entire mile, and i began whistling to it and have since revisited the road by car and on foot and seen the same bird who consistently follows me. in the past few days i have noticed an influx in posts on birds at attractors, is there something i am looking too much into, or is there something about birds? i found it pretty neat that things seemed to synchronize well, but then i also began to question the randomness of the whole thing - if at the end of the day, i was presented with exactly what i intended, how can i be certain that it was random? i am new, and have read the faq, but any additional thoughts are welcome. happy to provide photos/video but found it unnecessary!"

can't go but can't stop,2019-06-12,"i am new here. i have been trying to get the random generator to work for a week now. perhaps i am just an idiot that can't understand simple instructions. sometimes when i try the internet goes out (strangely it's been going out in the whole county),or i am interrupted by my children or work. however this week there has been a slew of interesting coincidences. note, i live in a hugely populated area. i hardly ever run into or meet someone without it being preplanned. i have only lived here for 3 years, and spend an outrageous amount of time working. i don't have the most social life, and spend a lot of time at work helping people through their problems even though it's not in the job description. monday, i purchased a small turtle nick-nack for my work space. no specific reason, just felt like i needed this small wooden turtle that bops it's head. later that day a coworker who had been on vacation comes in with a brand new turtle tattoo. when i asked what made them get the tattoo they said they had a random thought one day on vacation and decided to get it done. tuesday, i went to visit my brother in law in prison. i don't particularly care for him too much, but he has been in solitary for 3 months and i felt he was going crazy being alone. visit was okay, he was clearly in a troubled mental state, but glad to see someone from home. later that day at work i had a new client come through. he was acting odd at first and finally asked if i knew someone by my brother in laws name. i reluctantly said yes. apparently almost 5 years ago they were bunk mates at a reform camp for boys. he recalled and described to a t my husband and i in our wedding photo. hub and i share a different last name than the brother in law. wednesday was jammed packed. first thing early in the morning after dropping my kids off at school, i was driving (in my personal vehicle) down a divided highway in my area. while stopped at a light, i couldn't help but notice a young girl standing on her porch consistently pointing to the left. all the resonated with me was to turn left. at the next chance i had i turned left. parked on the side of the road was the turtle tat coworkers wife selling produce. i waved and kept going. i later had a dr.. appointment at a brand new office that opened up in town. i figured it would be worth a try to check out the office even though it was 30 minutes across town. i go in to check in, and there to greet me was one of my all time favorite clients who i have not spoke or heard of in almost a year. maybe it's just a strange coincidence. after the appointment i was rushing to work. i had to pick up a client. i noticed where all my other coworkers were picking up clients and was sorta bummed i wouldn't cross paths with anyone. after arriving to my first destination i parked the (company) car and waited for my client. not two minutes later a coworker in his company car pulls up and parks next to me. apparently he had a cancellation and was meeting someone new at the same exact location as i. in my head i was worried we were expecting the same client. then not even three minutes later, another coworker (in his company vehicle) pulls up and parks. except he says it was on the schedule all a long. long story short, 3 extremely confused stranger approached 3 identical vehicles trying to figure out which ride was theirs. there was also a strange scheduling incident which left me and several others perplexed. a student called in to check what day she scheduled an appointment. when my boss checked there were 5 different dates on the books in 5 different handwritings. no one remembers scheduling this new client, and we have an almost fail proof system that prevents over booking someone. one of my coworkers laughed and said ""must be a glitch in the matrix"" i ended up getting the student and it turns out she use to live in the same city in florida as my sister and they did pilates together. finally the birthday incident. forever all of my friends tend to be geminis. a new girl at work who i really like is a gemini. her birthday was last week. she had a rough day with an altercation with a student so i stayed behind while she finished grading and closed the office. i was making fun of her because she was a gemini and she asked my sign. i am an aquarius. she literally said stfu and asked my birthdate. apparently her sister and best friend share the same date as me. i have woken up today (6/12) absolutely drained. i honestly am reluctant to leave the house. i was reluctant to make this post. with my luck it won't post. perhaps i am just reading too far into all this or maybe not far enough."

"first timer, generated this ominous attractor (4.04)",2019-06-13,"i decided to finally try out the fatum bot today, and generated an attractor point for my myself, with a radius of 3000 meters around my home. the resulting point had a power rating of 4.04 and is about 5 minutes away by car. the point is close to the head of a three-way intersection, in front of a shipping/freight business. police love to park right there in their parking lot to watch traffic and catch speeders. the point was generated almost dead center over some sort of utility/electrical box, with warning signs... i decided to drive to the place, pull over my car along the side of the road and snap a photo of the point. the photo you see attached in this post is what i found at the point. there was another car coming up behind me quickly, and it's not exactly an ideal spot to hop out and explore, considering how often police are in the area, plus the high speed traffic, not to mention the multiple warning signs - so i snapped the 1 picture and started driving again. i hope to figure out a way to return to this point and visit on foot, if i can safely do it. there is a small creek that flows behind the point, hidden and out of plain sight. it seems this location is some kind of routing point for underground fiber optic cables (or at least that's the impression i get from the warning signs). i may have to bike there. or maybe i should just stay away completely, cherish the memory with the picture i took and move on. i don't get the warm &amp; fuzzies from this spot, which is all the more reason i feel i should try to explore it more thoroughly, when weather/time permits."

question to experienced randonauts!,2019-06-13,hi everyone! i found this sub through the glitch in the matrix subreddit. i was wondering if anyone who often goes on randonaut excursions has started noticing anything more glitchy than usual in the places you visit or even just glitchiness in your daily lives since youve been visiting attractors. i would love to hear your experiences! thanks! :)

fatum for cyberspace,2019-06-14,"not sure if this is allowed here, but i made a little python webapp for using the quantum number generator for surfing the web. it uses the same [quantum number generator](https://qrng.anu.edu.au/) as fatum and chooses random subreddits or wiki articles. unlike fatum, my app does not use attractors - it only uses one randomly generated number. this is like using \\getquantum in fatum. i got this idea from a post from about a week ago that i can't find any more. anyway, here you go.

all the points i get are in schools or other private property.,2019-06-14,"the first quantum point i got was in a public park. reached there as soon as possible. but after that, all the points i have got (either quantum or attractor) are in schools, homes of people. one was near a police station. after the park point, i tried to visit next two points but couldn't get completely there, so got as close as possible. became sick the next day. ( any co-relation ? ) my question is, if all the points i get are in such inaccessible places, what should i do ? are there any consequences of getting points but not visiting them ? ps : i am in a major urban city."

4.97 attractor - some sort of antenna?,2019-06-15,"weather was optimal for randonauting tonight, so i generated an attractor point with my home as the center and a radius of 3000 m. got a hit for a spot with a 4.97 rating. it's in an area i'm pretty familiar with - used to be an air force base (located next to our airport) and has since been turned into an industrial park, of sorts. there's a laundry-machine manufacturer nearby, i used to clean their building at night and as such i feel a sort of connection with the whole area - it is a place that i like. (coincidentally, my uncle used to own their biggest rival company on the other side of the country.) the attractor that was generated was down the road bit. the spot is right next to some sort of distribution warehouse for a local hot dog company. why they have this tiny little warehouse out in this random area is beyond me, but it must have some usefulness for them. what strikes me the most about the attractor point area is the presence of some kind of large antenna. &amp;#x200b; https://i.redd.it/3t3rw8h4hf431.jpg the antenna must be relatively new, because it is not visible using google maps satellite imagery (although it is visible if you use street view, so it's not like it was just built). probably some telecommunications company is paying the hot dog company to keep one of their antennas on their property, or something to that effect. unfortunately, i couldn't get much closer to the antenna or the attractor spot tonight. the only 3 ways to the spot are through a field of neck-high grass, going on the property of the hot dog warehouse (quite a few cameras along the sides of the building make it problematic) or approaching from the back. this 3rd option is what i'd like to try. if i can find a reasonable spot to park my car or have a friend give me a ride, getting to the antenna/attractor spot from the rear is no problem, as there is actually a dirt road that used to be a real road 40 some-odd years ago leading back there. i know this isn't the most thrilling story in the world, but i felt it was at least worth sharing on here due to the large attractor power."
i know what's up (i think),2019-06-15,"recently i started a series of stories (basically crazy coincidences) about my life experiences on r/glitches_in_the_matrix. and every one of them (i noticed) begins with doing something random. something that i usually don't do or talk about. basically one random thing leads you to the similar thing in the most unexpected moment or place you d never expected it to be. maybe our matrix doesn't have such a thing like random, maybe i was programmed to do or experience such thing and the scary part, maybe me writing this post was already programmed. i just found it somewhat similar to what you guys do. you do some random thing which somehow insanely correlates to your not random life."
"first adventure, wasnt disappointed",2019-06-15,"i, like several others, located this sub through the glitch_in_the_matrix community and was thoroughly intrigued by the idea. ive been trying to figure out how to step out of my norm for some time and, whether you believe were part of a simulation or this simply helps you get outside your normal routine, i see the introduction of randomness being key to enjoying new blood in my life. i went through the steps to download telegram and set it up, and generated an attractor point with a 4.95 strength a quarter mile away from me. there, i found an out-of-the-ordinary yellow fire hydrant (all others on the street were red) with a pair of tags attached. behind it in a rock garden by the sidewalk was a stone pair of hands inscribed by his hands we all are fed. definitely looking forward to using this more!"

asked for an attractor for the first time in two months...,2019-06-15,and it put the pin down right on top of a friends house. she passed away last week. im a little shaken by it honestly...in your experience have you received attractors based upon things youve been thinking about? what exactly does an attractor point mean? im not in a densely populated area and theres no mistaking it- the point is definitely on property that she owned and im pretty sure its right on top of the house.
first experiences,2019-06-15,"ok, i found this group after studying simulation theory and looking for means to hack the matrix. at first, i started this for a bit of fun and didnt really think anything would come of it, nor did i think i would stick at it. but, after 4 attractor points, ive seen enough to seriously spark my curiosity! ill explain my experiences so far, but as im still new to this, it would be useful if those with more experience and understanding could help me interpret my encounters. my first attractor point took be to an industrial estate. the exact spot was behind a starbucks id been to many times before. when i got there, i spotted several oddities: 1/ a family restaurant that id never seen before but must have passed a hundred times over. it had a play park at the front, which was interesting because i have kids and thought i knew every kid friendly restaurant in the city. also, this restaurant is 5 minutes away by car from my house! 2/ a bird walking around, not flying, just walking around near my car. 3/ a takeaway coffee cup sitting at a very weird angle (i.e. diagonal) in the middle of the road. 3/ a swarm of birds screaming and circling over a cash and carry. i also spotted a little pass i hadnt noticed before somewhere between the starbucks and the cash and carry. i must have drove down that road a hundred times and this was the first time id spotted it. when i walked down, i found a hidden away gated entrance to some sort of laboratory or technology company i hadnt heard of before. my second point was mostly unremarkable, but i did encounter a black bird walking around. i did my third and four points back to back. the first took me to an industrial estate where i found a bird walking around a car park and a trashed car. the trashed car was very odd, it had a plank of wood jammed vertically between the driver seat and the passenger seat. as i was walking away, i noticed birds perched on several lampposts looking at me. the four point was in a wooded area, i couldnt quite reach the exact spot, but found a good viewing point see i had been led to a strange looking tree. the only thing that stood out was he sound of a bird cawing. since these 4 points, ive been hooked! i did 7 points today and encountered several strange occurrences along the way, including finding an owl statue. ill post some details once i get my head around them. has anyone else found themselves feeling drained after visiting several sites?"
my first joueney!,2019-06-16,"so i finally got off my ass and checked out some of the attractors i generated! i am still outand will probably visit some more but i am currently chilling with the sweeyest kitty next to me! also, i'm on mobile so excuse me if this post is a mess. the first one i visited was a 3.03 and i came across this weird structure that was kind of like a [lookout post](https://i.imgur.com/hcbdeac.jpg) [inside](https://i.imgur.com/bt31age.jpg) [had a kiddy chair](https://i.imgur.com/mhbhq33.jpg) [a cup on the top part](https://i.imgur.com/3jfvane.jpg) anyway then i went to the next one (4.56) but it just led me to this [gate](https://i.imgur.com/gfllprk.jpg) that led to someone' garden or something. i was heading to rhe next one and encountered this beautiful kitten that i've been camping next to for at least 20 min now, haha. [she is such a sweetheart!](https://i.imgur.com/lxr7mmb.jpg) [this one ](https://i.imgur.com/14smgrx.jpg) came by just as i was writing this :d"
my first journey pt. 2,2019-06-16,"so! i am finally home. i visited 3 other attracors but didn't find anything too interesting anymore. number 3 (2.something, i accidentally deleted the message) was on private property and i couldn't even take a look inside, but while trying to peek in i found this [sort of plum](https://i.imgur.com/dbfhyh0.jpg) i like next to it! (it's called ringlo here, but i'm no sure what it's called in english.) on the way there i saw some grafitti but i forgot to take a picture of them. i remember one read ""our dreams are your nightmares"" (in slovenian) though. number 4 (5.52) lead me to an art studio (and [place of worship](https://www.google.com/search?q=atelier+stepanov&amp;source=lmns&amp;bih=600&amp;biw=360&amp;client=ms-android-huawei&amp;prmd=imnv&amp;hl=en&amp;ved=2ahukewjgjz2u7uziahvfwoukhf8bdraq_auoahoecaaqaw) according to google, weird) that i couldn't go into because it was like 3 am. the actual point was behind the building, where i found [this lil' mushroom](https://i.imgur.com/yvj3dss.jpg) the fifth and last attractor (3.31) was in an apartment building so there was nothing to really see there, but here's [me with a couple of flowers](https://i.imgur.com/8flf80i.jpg) i picked up in front of it!"
chasing my own tail,2019-06-16,"today i decided to visit as many attractor points in a row as possible, starting from my house and using a radius of 3000 meters each time. i didn't have much of a specific goal in mind before setting out, other than potentially collapsing my stasis field and cracking out of my current reality tunnel. although i stopped by 7 attractor points and was quite close to an 8th, i don't think i was necessarily successful. &amp;#x200b; the 1st attractor point (5.21) along my journey was in a wooded area next to a truck stop. tractor trailers left and right, all over the place. i was able to pull my car over and get a good glance around the area. i'd like to note that this spot was on a road that forks out, with both forks being dead-ends. i was on the west fork, and opposed to the east fork. i generated my next attractor point and headed out; i had to turn around at the end of the fork. there's a local ice cream truck company that has its hq down there. as i was turning around, i saw an old ice cream truck parked in a spot next to the woods. the truck was old and rusty, it looked like it hadn't been used in a decade. it also looked exactly like the ice cream truck that used to come around my neighborhood when i was a kid - maybe it was! &amp;#x200b; on my way to my 2nd attractor point (1.64), i had the option to go back the way i came, or keep going toward the point from a new direction. i chose the latter option. the point wasn't much, it was generated in the area of a bunch of apartment buildings that i didn't know were there. in front of the buildings, i generated my third spot. &amp;#x200b; along the way to my 3rd attractor point (3.14) i drove through the neighborhood my mother-in-law lives in, totally by coincidence. i even drove past her house. it was probably the nicest part of my journey all day. i arrived at the attractor point, which was in the parking lot near a dunkin' donuts and an ice cream shop. there was nothing special about the spot, but there was a lime green lighter sitting in the middle of the parking lot. i was very tempted to get out and take it with me, but i left it. in hindsight, i regret not taking it with me. i think this was the critical mistake i made today. &amp;#x200b; the 4th attractor point (1.69) was in someone's backyard, but there is a park and tennis/basketball courts directly next the yard, close enough to the point. i had some trouble getting to this point; my car has been acting up lately and my check engine light was on almost all day. particularly between the 3rd and 4th points, i was concerned about my car breaking down, as the engine was being very jumpy (i think it needs a fuel treatment). when i arrived at the park and the 4th point, i did not get out of my car to wander around. there were several people playing basketball directly in the spot i would have ventured to and it would have been pretty weird on my part. i decided to move on and generate the next point, as i felt i was close enough. &amp;#x200b; my car was running fine again after resting for a few minutes. my 5th attractor point (5.46) was smack in the middle of someone's backyard, but there was an apartment complex with a parking lot directly across from the spot. that is where i ended up, and i took the below photo of the wooded area: &amp;#x200b; &amp;#x200b; [what is out there?](https://i.redd.it/5w4imhpdxm431.jpg) &amp;#x200b; the house on this property looked completely rundown (unfortunately, not visible in the photo i took). part of me wishes i had simply parked in their driveway, as i would have been closer to the point and i think i could have gotten away with it. there was a car in the driveway, but it looked like it hadn't been used in a year or more. i didn't even realize the condition of the house until i was leaving and on my way to my next point. it very much felt to me like someone had passed away and the spirit was the attractor point i generated in the woods there, but who knows. that is just speculation and gut feeling on my part, nothing to validate that! &amp;#x200b; anyways, i was on my way to my 6th attractor point (7.50), which was directly in front of someone's house in a fairly nice neighborhood, on a dead end road. i drove there and parked in front of the house, to generate my next point. i noticed some sort of electrical box in the front yard - all i could read on it was ""warning"" and ""stop."" &amp;#x200b; my 7th attractor point (5.48) was in front of another house, on yet another dead end road in yet another really nice neighborhood. just like last time, i drove there, generated my next point, and moved on. i definitely attracted the attention of the neighbors. &amp;#x200b; my 8th and ultimately final attractor point (4.19) was near a local restaurant/farmer's market. i got as close as i could, but the point was back on company property, in the area where they grow their flowers. i decided to end my journey there, but i don't think that it ended at that point. &amp;#x200b; i went back home and, to simplify things, i had to make a choice - choosing to do something for my wife (who was at work), or choosing to do something for myself. i chose my wife and ended up driving out to meet her to drop her wedding ring off to her. had i not visited those 7 attractor points earlier, i would not have been where i was, when i was. i would not have had the 2 choices in front of me (myself or my wife); i would have already chosen myself and would not have been home to get her ring and drive it to her. &amp;#x200b; i had to drive down to the area where i generated my first attractor point earlier today, past the truck stop. i rarely go over there anymore, let alone twice in one day. when i dropped the ring off, she was rather ungrateful and nagged me for not doing anything around the house today (oh the humanity!). i was irritated at that point. right after i had drove away, she got a call and had to leave that spot to head back into the city. i went back home and, feeling unsatisfied, decided to try something totally different. &amp;#x200b; i set my location as back at my house, set the radius to 1000 meters, and decided to see where the nearest void was. a point was generated (1.66) one street over from me. i can see the street from my kitchen window. i put on my shoes and decided to go for a walk around the block. &amp;#x200b; the weather has been iffy all day, and there was rain in the forecast for this afternoon. when i left for my walk, it was certainly overcast. i didn't care. as soon as i set foot on the street with the void on it, it began raining. there was a family out walking, on the other side of the street but headed down the same direction as me. it was one of those awkward situations where we were sort of walking next to each other, so i picked up the pace and walked faster to get past them. &amp;#x200b; it began raining harder. a black van pulled out of a driveway ahead and began moving towards me. the people i had walked past a moment ago ran toward the van and hopped in. i had to walk on someone's lawn in order to get out of the van's way. i hate walking on people's lawns, but whatever. the van drove off once the family was in and i finally felt alone, peaceful. i looked up at the nearest house - house number 133 - and made a mental note of exactly where i was. &amp;#x200b; i kept on going, around the block. as i turned the corner back onto the street i live on, it began pouring even harder. i kept walking back down towards my house. i felt really good despite being all wet; i felt like i had dropped off some negative energy i was carrying back when i passed through the void point. i felt like i had wiped the slate clean on the day. had i? &amp;#x200b; when i got back home, the rain ceased. i checked out the map on my phone (i left my phone at the house). i found house number 133 on the map (the house is painted a deep, bright blue) and then checked to see where the void point was in relation to that. the void center was... right directly in front of house number 133... &amp;#x200b; i decided to sort of reset things. with my house as my location, i set a radius of 3000 meters and decided to generate a quantum location, as opposed to a full-blown attractor point. i got as close to the quantum location as i could - i parked in the parking lot of a bar &amp; grill. the point itself was right next to the highway. i decided to generate some attractor points from that location; i set the radius to 10,000 meters and the first attractor point was in a village notorious for bored police and my car is past inspection. the next point i generated, i reduced the radius to 5000 meters and got another spot right directly next to a highway on-ramp. finally, i reduced the radius to 3000 meters and generated another attractor point. this spot was reachable - the parking lot of a plumbing supply company. i headed out. &amp;#x200b; this attractor point had a rating of 4.52. the business is not open saturday nights, but i saw someone in the building through the front window, probably a janitor. i pulled into the parking lot to generate my next attractor point. the person/people in the building suddenly turned off all the lights - they were either leaving, or were sketched out by my presence. as soon as i had my next point, i left. &amp;#x200b; my next attractor point (3.70) was the last point i went to today. this is the weirdest one. the point was generated along the route i had walked earlier, right at the spot where i crossed back onto my own street and it had begun pouring rain, after i had ""left the void."" so, i drove to this corner, set it as my location, and generated what should have been the 3rd point in this attractor chain. but the point generated... was almost exactly where the prior point had been, next to the plumbing supply business. this time, however, its attractor power level had been nearly cut in half, down from 4.52 all the way to 2.83. i didn't return, because i had just been there, and had already possibly sketched out their cleaning crew. given all of this, i decided to call it quits for the day. what are the odds of generating essentially the same point, two different times? &amp;#x200b; i feel like today was a lot of chasing my own tail. as far as breaking out of my probability tunnel, i feel like today i sort of skimmed the sides of the tunnel with my fingers and maybe made some ripples. but i have a long ways to go if i want to change my reality. i go back to earlier in the day, at my third attractor point... i don't know why, but i feel like if i had picked up that green lighter in the parking lot, things would have played out differently. i don't feel like my reality will change, until i myself make a change. until then, i feel like i am chasing my own tail. i keep pulling at the loose ends of my life, hoping to undo the knot, but sometimes only making it tighter. can i discover exactly which strings to pull and how hard to pull them, so that i can undo the metaphysical knot that i am in? &amp;#x200b; tl;dr of interesting things: &amp;#x200b; \- i made note of a particular blue house (number 133) without realizing it was right smack dab on my generated void point \- it only rained while i was on my walk around the block to visit said void point \- i later had an attractor point generated along the route i had walked, at a spot where it had particularly started pouring rain during my walk \- i generated an attractor point (4.52) at a plumbing supply company; 20 minutes later i tried to generate another attractor but the point was once again at this plumbing company and the power level was reduced to 2.83 &amp;#x200b; i'd like to add a disclaimer, and maybe i should put this at the beginning, but oh well. i realize that is isn't the most riveting story in the world. maybe you barely read any of it - i understand. i am approaching this randonaut thing from a more scientific point of view. at this stage, i'm keeping an open mind. these posts are simply me recording my observations, nothing more and nothing less. i don't share all of my experiences on here, but if i feel it is worthwhile and maybe adds some new data to the conversation, then i think it is worth posting. take from it what you will, be that nothing or something."

7 attractor points,2019-06-16,"fairly epic saturday this week, managed 7 attractor points. my first two point took me to an industrial estate. the first point took me to an abandoned building, which looked like it was straight out of the 1970s. one of the windows stood out as it was lined with old fashioned looking porcelain vases. i spotted some graffiti and captured a couple of photos. next, i was taken down an odd side road which led to a dead end. the attractor point was on top of a lamppost surrounded by a pile of gravel. as i looked around, i realised i was right next to what looked a like an active building site in the final stages, i.e. the building was up and workmen were working on the interior. i spotted a coffee shop/ baker next to the site, which struck me as an odd location, as it was tucked away and not visible from the main road, so theres no way i would ever think to go there or even know it existed if not for the attractor point. i remembered that some folk had recommended to interact with the environment, so i decided to buy a coffee. when i went in, i asked for a cappuccino twice, and the staff brought me a cup of tea. when i pointed out that id ordered a cappuccino, the two girls working acted very shocked, they gave a refund, a free cup of coffee and asked if i wanted to raise a complaint. i told them not to worry about it as it wasnt a big deal. the whole experience felt a bit odd, almost like i wasnt supposed to be there and was out of sync with things. i generated the third point later that afternoon. it pointed to what looked like the grounds of a local posh hotel. but when i got there, i realised the attractor point was actually behind the hotel and allow a road i didnt know existed. when i followed it, it took me to a fancy looking partially built isolated suburb. there were signs everywhere advertising the show homes, but there were also plenty of houses with cars parked in the driveways, so obviously people were already living there. as i drove around, i felt yet again, like i wasnt supposed to be there. due to construction works, i.e. fences, etc, it took a bit of driving and detouring to eventually reach the attractor point, which was within a fenced off construction site next to what looked like some sort of fancy community centre. i should have taking some photos, but i felt very out of place and decided to leave. so, i drove off until i felt more comfortable, and then generated another attractor point. this time it took me to a local park and gold course. the point was basically on the road that ran through the park so i figured it would be easy to get to. when i got there, i noticed the attractor point was approximately on top of a small dead patch of grass on a golf course that was otherwise green. i dont know if thats significant. i decided to do one last point, which led me to a rock in the ground. captured a photo and left. later that day, i was meeting family at a local kids place. but i got there early and decided to try and fit in one more point. the point generated was 5 minutes along the road, so decided to kill some time while waiting. i was led to a small garage, which looked a little odd, but nothing out of the ordinary. then i turned around and spotted some graffiti, so i took some more photos. just as i was about to head off, i spotted an owl statue in a garden opposite the garage and captured another couple of photos. later that day, i went to my local supermarket to pick up stuff for my daughter. i noticed that the large deli counter was gone and had been replaced with shelving. i visit that particular supermarket at least 2-3 times a week and this was the first time id noticed. i mentioned this to family who use the same supermarket, and they told me it had been gone for at least 2 weeks and laughed at my lack of observation."

thank you randonauts for proving this lurker wrong.,2019-06-18,"i've been lurking this sub on and off for a short time, both out of curiosity and skepticism. i often found myself reading posts here that could be so easily dismissed by coincidence or ""ideas of reference"" that could hardly be taken seriously. even so, i decided to find my first attractor today. i recognized the location as soon as i received it and almost gave up knowing that it was just an unremarkable spot behind a nearby warehouse. when i arrived, i saw exactly what i expected - an enormous blank white wall. as i got to the exact attractor point, i found a small, inconspicuously placed door that was propped wide open. what i saw inside was both unexpected and hit very close to home on a personal issue i've been avoiding and struggling with as of late. the experience has really moved me, and i just wanted to express my gratefulness to this community for not only giving me access to a personally defining moment, but also for not being pushy, creepy, or dogmatic about this topic because that would have deterred me from even thinking about giving it a try. i'm so glad i did and i'm looking forward to exploring more. thank you randonauts!"
sydney harbor,2019-06-18,"hi all, i was a brief lurker then decided to fire it up in sydney and see what happened. i ran it about 25 times since yesterday morning and started to plot them out on a map. most points were around the harbor and often actually smack bang in the harbor. i went to my first place yesterday (mid-3's) and it was just a residential house, but there was a camera pointed at the entrance, not that it means much. second place i went to was the biggest i'd gotten up until that point (6.61) and was in the harbor again, not far from a oil ship dock and a naval base. the third place i went to was another house (4's), and nothing odd was around, at least that i could see. the fourth site was an empty park which was in front of a lot of packed-in apartment blocks. what was weird about it was that most places actually run right up to the water (you know, property prices, views etc), but this had a massive empty park, with nothing but grass on it, and then park benches, gardens, bbqs etc around the sides. i looked at the apartment blocks (where the point was centered), and there were lightning poles on all the buildings (which were max 8 stories high). why have those there? i don't know much about lightning, but i always assumed it struck the most conductive and tallest point, not some apartments almost on sea level? but i saw a sign saying ""submarine cables"" and they went parallel to a bridge across the harbor (not the harbor bridge, but victoria rd). &amp;#x200b; now, i skipped the gym to go to the above points on the way to my biggest attractor level i'd seen so far: **16.61**. it was in the water just south of cockatoo island (a former convict establishment where re-offenders were sent in the mid-1800's, and a unesco world heritage site). i can't actually get to the island without a reason - an event, a ferry or taxi etc - but it was still in the water between the island and the lookout point opposite it (but closer to the island). what was interesting is that i saw an underwater pipe running from the mainland to the island, directly across where i was standing and running through the point in the water. interestingly, i walked down and saw another ""submarine cable"" sign. could be completely unrelated, but it might explain why a lot of these points are appearing in the harbor or on the shore nearby? i don't know... &amp;#x200b; any thoughts? i am super keen to go back to cockatoo island and explore, but i'll need to plan that trip a bit. note: birds did like to chill on the water around the spot, but i didn't see anything that stood out too much."

data trails like fingernails scratch across the sky,2019-06-19,"as soon as i left work today, i decided to generate and visit a quantum point before going home, because why not. the weather has been nice despite rain in the forecast. i hopped in my trusty ol' car, set my location, radius to 1000 meters, and generated a quantum point. the point is about 5 minutes from where i work, down a road i have never actually ventured down before, despite spending much time driving around out here over the years. the road that the quantum point was generated next to is host to numerous businesses and companies - a sort of self-contained industrial park, complete with a hotel. i drove past the point and didn't see anything noteworthy. i pulled into a small parking lot to turn around and suddenly a big ol' fedex truck came out of nowhere and almost hit me as i was looking to pull out. driver honked at me, because of course, i was in the ""wrong,"" even though this dude must have been going way over the speed limit. i think he was taking out some negative energy on me, it took a while to shake this dude's crap off of me. at that point, i was really irritated. i returned to the quantum point, but this time pulled over to the side of the road to check this out closer. i discovered a bank of satellite dishes, completely fenced off and unaccessible. makes sense, as spectrum (an isp) has a large office right there, very near the dishes. there is only one way in/out of the fenced off area containing the dishes, through a large, locked gate. i took a couple photos of the area from next to the road; you can see parts of dishes through the trees but not much. nothing was visible when i looked through the gate entrance, just a dirt trail. &amp;#x200b; [satellites and trees](https://i.redd.it/8rgyxfbpi7531.jpg) &amp;#x200b; interesting that a quantum point was generated directly over this bank of dishes. looking at google maps, satellite view, there appear to be 12 total dishes. i don't think that they are necessarily anything secret or special; they are also right next to i-90 and easily visible to people driving eastbound. going to attractor points is interesting but i'm finding that visiting quantum points is just as intriguing. why satellite dishes?"

alright i'll give it to you guys.. this is weird.,2019-06-19,"first timer. i live in new zealand which has maybe less ideal locations that a person could travel to, that's what i expected.. i decided town would be the best place to start so i headed to the center and smack in the middle is a park [with a statue.](https://imgur.com/ukgxzya). generated my first attractor, something like power 2.01 which is low. it was a place i had been before. ok, i thought i'd chain it when i got there. off i went in the direction and [passed a church offering free coffee and tea](https://imgur.com/pcqhwvo) which is a low-key odd, since when did christians drink coffee? moving on, i reached my destination and looked around. [saw a horse trailer](https://imgur.com/pjs5xg4), not very meaningful. spotted a car license plate ['how sad'!?](https://imgur.com/scf5abq). nothing else noteworthy at that moment, tried to generate the next chain from that location. ten minutes pass and no response, looking around i [spot an object](https://imgur.com/58xddik) in the sky. [a ufo!?](https://imgur.com/vvielrn). after quickly snapping a pic it stops shining then fades into nothingness in clear blue skies. instant goosebumps. 20 minutes had passed, tried to generate the next chain a second time; no response from the bot. decided to leave it at that. had lunch, made my way back to the car. i try to give the bot another go and it gave me an error and a low 1.32 power location along with that error. ignored it and went home. getting the pics off my phone spat out errors that my iphone xs max was busy!? since when! after a few tries, i managed to copy each image individually. so here i am to share. it's been a weird day and i wonder if i'm forever trapped in an alternate existence of sorts. maybe some of you dont like that suggestion but if you're generating a truly random quantum location and stepping off your fated pathway, there's no going back from that. you're going somewhere off the trail. unless reality is always spitting out quantum randomness in general. just a thought."

biking adventures,2019-06-20,"this is my first post so ill start off by saying that im super intrigued by this sub. ive enjoyed other gps treasure hunts and ar games in the past but i really love abstract thought that goes along with this. i think theres something to wrap your head around here if you choose to. its definitely not a game. ive been doing a lot of bike riding this season anyway so when i found this sub i figured it be fun to combine the two. i generated a couple points the other night as soon as i got setup. both of them were in residential areas but my quantum point just so happened to be directly on a route ive been riding heavily for the last month. i was finally able to get out on the bike tonight and headed my usual direction. the point was basically in someones front yard so i didnt really want to stop and gawk. i rolled by slow and took in what i could. there was no one around but a small dog tied up in front and there was kids clothes all over the yard, like some toddler got tired of being dressed and just ditched everything. not really something i cared to document with a picture. i continued on to where the road meets the actual bike trail and stopped for a sip of water. i decided to get an attractor point while i was there. i get one about 500 meters away just off the trail in a slightly wooded spot. the strength was only 1.77. it brought me to a drainage area where there are a couple of [ponds](https://i.imgur.com/7g7xr2v.jpg) and some dirt hills where you could tell people would ride their four wheelers. i had always kinda known this was all there but didnt stop to look around much until tonight. it was the kind of place in the woods where kids hide their porno mags for sure. i did see a groundhog run out of the tall grass but i wasnt quick enough to get his pic. i headed toward my other point which was right smack dab in the middle of someones backyard. it was up against some church property and separated by a privacy fence. from the church lot i didnt see much so i went to find the house from the front. turned out to be the middle house in a small cul de sac. the house on the right as you enter, had an odd island of landscaping in the yard with a gargoyle statue in the middle. id have liked to get a pic but i kinda feel strange about being some weird dude on the street photographing peoples homes. so that was my first experience, nothing mind blowing necessarily but i do find it interesting that it pointed me to places on my biking routes. i did generate another point just a little bit ago and i hope to visit that one tomorrow evening. hopefully i discover something worth reporting."

cemetery,2019-06-20,"fatum generated adventures feels to me partly similar to aimlessly wandering around a foreign town. i had some time in the past couple of days to go to multiple points and i realized this morning that despite staying in the parameters of my hometown, i feel a little homesick and like i miss my 'routine', even if my routine before discovering randonauting included aimless drives and walks when there is time for that. despair is interesting. yesterday, the bot revealed an attractor point in a graveyard. the point was placed over an empty piece of ground (future grave) next to the grave of a ww2 vet who died at age 97. i also am aware that one person i knew in high school is buried there, but i don't know where their grave is located, nor did i run into it. i'm in a desert city in the summer, so i have mostly been driving to attractors and voids accessible by car, but i got out of my car and spent about an hour walking around. i took a few pictures of some head stones which caught my attention. i looked up the names on the stones when i got home. one of them was the name of a woman who had been killed by her boyfriend in a murder suicide a few years ago. this graveyard was beautiful, but most graveyards can be in their way. this is a newer graveyard, though, so not many forgotten graves/forgotten people. wind chimes hanging in the trees and brilliant harsh desert sunshine... fake flowers and other offerings on almost every head stone. the farther i got away from the attractor, my mind wandered to the physical aspect of death and how i was walking over so many decaying bodies (duh i'm in a grave yard), but it felt like i could see and feel 6 feet below me in every direction, and i started to get an alarming feeling that i was disrespectful to be there as a journeyer more than a mourner. despair again. i had to get back to my car a.s.a.p. and leave. &amp;#x200b; t.l.d.r. it took me to a grave yard to an empty plot"
starting out with this,2019-06-20,"so i've now been just over a week experimenting with the fatum bot and thought i'd post my experiences so far. nothing remarkable compared to some of the other accounts here (no owl statues so far) but that's perhaps to be expected as i live in the country and many of the locations i've been given have turned out to be in inaccessible fields on private land. first location i tried was a 2.06 attractor at the bottom end of a car park that i was already familiar with - i managed to get to the location, and generated a new attractor point. nothing strange there to report, and the only objects were cigarette ends so decided not to take a souvenir. the new attractor point, power 3.84, was in a field down a road i'd never driven before, the field was full of cows and i couldn't get close due to a hedge. i did find a straw on the footpath next to the field so i picked this up and it's been sitting in my car for the last week. unfortunately although i had good phone reception the bot failed to send me another attractor at the point, so my chain stopped there. next attractor generated, power 2.92, down another small country road in an inaccessible field. i got as close as i could and picked up a plastic object which looked as if it had broken off a vehicle. once again, the bot failed to respond while i was in location so i wasn't able to continue with a chain. i've also visited a 3.18 attractor which was in a housing estate - didn't like to hang around too long here and i couldn't get a response when in location to generate a new chain. finally, i visited another point yesterday which was in a lake - i got as close as i could to the edge. no despair meme or unusual experiences to report so far, aside from not getting a response at several of the locations to continue the chain each time. it's a bit odd as it usually seems to work fine at home, so perhaps that is the quantum field trying to stop me going further (or, more likely, just a coincidence)! i did experience some good luck after visiting the 3.84 point when i had a reply from a company about a parcel i'd been chasing and had it delivered last week, but then also had some bad luck when i missed out on an ebay auction for an item in my watch-list that has never shown up for sale before in over 5 years. again, probably coincidence! will keep going with this and report back if i find anything interesting..."

first experience ...,2019-06-22,"hello, last night i visited a 3+ attractor point several miles from my home. this was near midnight. the point indicated a house, and that house was lit at every window and a woman was standing in the front yard. a train track ran close by. i drove on and immediately encountered an impressive buck. his antlers were very large and he was standing directly in front of my car as i approached a dead-end. i later encountered a red fox, he stood in the beam of my headlights looking at me before running off across someone's yard. i discovered a strange compound with multiple no trespassing signs. i trespassed. at one point i drove my car across a grassy berm that held a stone path wide enough for a car. it was a small, surreal thrill. i don't understand what this path is for. i should go back and get a photograph. after leaving this compound i saw another red fox, or the same fox as before. i can't be sure. i drove past the point again from the other side of the block and arrived at the train tracks just as the crossing gate was lowering. the gate paused and then retracted suddenly and i put my car into drive and then the gate swung down again and the lights started flashing and the train whistle blew. it was bizarre. i looked to my left and saw a rental property for sale. i am a real estate investor. i exited my car and took a picture of the for sale sign with my phone. today my wallet fell from my pocket onto the sidewalk in the center of my busy town and a lawyer found it and guessed my email address by simply combining my first and last name at gmail. i drove to his office and he returned the wallet including every dollar of cash. nothing in this world is as it seems. good night and god bless."

scary interaction at an attractor point,2019-06-22,"i am fairly new to reddit, new to randonauts, the fatum bot and attractor points. i live in an urban area near a big park and ive enjoyed visiting different attractor points, often with very cool synchronicities. and i love seeing peoples photos and reading their experiences on this sub. yesterday i received an attractor point deep in a neighborhood ive never gone. i was able to walk there and felt fine, enjoying the beautiful weather. i saw on google maps my attractor point was between a police station and a small business and my first thought was, ok, at least ill know ill be safe checking out this block. when the police station came into view i was overcome with fear and unease. i immediately took out my earbuds. note im from a demographic that is hardly ever targeted by police, was never a victim of a serious crime and i was raised to ask the friendly policeman for help so seeing police doesnt usually come with a trigger. as i approach the attractor point, i realize its in a police impound lot! ha. there are huge no trespassing signs so i linger outside trying to get a view of the point, still uneasy and jumpy. all of a sudden i hear a police megaphone and a cop asks me to come to his a car. he very sternly asks what im doing and im filled with fear and dont know what to say. umm, i was given this location? that doesnt sound good ... he then tells me i need to go into the police station. he repeated this several times. scared, i nodded yes and walked away. the entrance to the station was out of his view so i just walked away. the rest of the day i felt strange and unnerved, like i did something wrong, a reaction in exaggeration of what was in hindsight a harmless interaction."

(i posted the picture yesterday) we then find another page (all the pages seemed to come from the same pad of paper in a file folder, which we found both of) with an address on it. the street the address was on actually intersected the attraction point. kinda cool. there were some other synchronicities between the paper and point, all the notes in the pages seemed to be about home renovations that were being measured and priced. the bag we were collecting the pages in happened to be a home depot bag and when we got to the attraction spot it was at a house that was under renovations, in the middle of building a new driveway. stacks of bricks and building materials everywhere. we decide to do another point from there. it leads us just around the corner but it wouldve required us to jump over the guard rail and trek through some heavy brush. the kids were tired at this point so we abandoned it. today we decide to go on another adventure, i set the radius to 5000 meters and it sends us to a random point on an old back road, it seemed to be in someones back yard and since there was nowhere to park we drive a bit further and find a parking lot with hiking trails. the trail ends up leading us exactly to the attraction point, which ends up being in a random point in a forest with no real focal points. so we decide to generate a new attraction point but get a result that says invalid so i decide to generate a void instead. the void point ends up being on the exact same street the address from the papers were on! so we drive there and stroll the neighbourhood, the point is still pretty far down from the actual house number on the papers. the void was at house 326 and the address was 89. curiosity makes me walk to 89 anyway, ends up being just a normal house. i didnt want to look suspicious so i didnt spend too much time checking it out. so we generate a new attraction from there and it pops up almost the same point we abandoned yesterday. this time we explore it a bit more and find a path that leads us almost exactly there. the actual spot is in dense brush, we start hearing a bird that almost sounds like its calling my name. at this point my little girl is tired and we head home. what a crazy adventure. i feel compelled to return all these random notes to the address now. i might drop them in their mailbox in the middle of the night. the strange part is two of my points were almost the same as yesterday?? has this happened to anyone? ill definitely be paying attention to these two spots in the future."

owl experiment chain report 1,2019-06-23,"this is a log of my experience with a 3 long attractor chain going in with the open intention of finding information regarding the object that replaced the owl sitting on top of the fatum bot server. i'm not going to directly make a defined guess as to what the object is based on my experience, i'm just logging my experiences as a randonaut during the period the picture of the object is encrypted so that after the picture is revealed there is solid record to be able to look for connections from. time | experience log ---|--- 1:37 pm| raining pretty hard with nobody outside, but streets are busy with cars. generated 1st attractor point with radius of 3000, power of 3.38, and starting location at my house. the point was 2.43 km away. on the drive there, i noticed a prevailing theme of the numbers 3 and 9 on street signs, house numbers, license plates, etc. often times they are bunched together in groups (ex: ""333"" ""393"" ""939"".) 1:57 pm| at the area of the attractor was several office buildings with half-filled parking lots. there was a nice creek flowing behind the offices with some geese and ducks. i had never been in this area before. the weirdest thing that happened at this attractor was that while i was sitting in my car in the parking lot in a completely empty area away from the rest of the cars, a man (likely from one of the buildings) in a white button down shirt and black dress pants ran across right in front of my car soaking wet from the rain. he was holding nothing, just running through the rain. he continued to run and then crossed the street out of view. two license plates in the parking lot stood out to me. one with the letters ""toy"" and another with a custom plate saying ""luv2sty100"" (""love to stay 100""?). 1:58 pm| i set my location at the current attractor point and attempted to generate a new one with a radius of 3000 once again, and the fatum bot did not respond despite good service. i switched over to the ""randonaut_bot"" telegram and that one ended up working fine. 2:04 pm| i generated the next attractor. radius 3000, power 2.41. on the drive there i paid close attention to any informational details in the environment around me. i saw 2 or 3 more custom plates but do not remember what they said. a cleaning service truck drove past me in an intersection with 3333 as the last 4 digits of the phone number. 2:15 pm| i arrived at the 2nd attractor which was a small neighborhood with small nice homes. the attractor led me down to a dead end in the road. the neighborhood was on ""33rd avenue"" and all the houses street adresses started with 3. one in particular at the end of the dead end road was had the address ""3330"". the exact location of the attractor was a house towards the beginning of the dead end road with a very busy front yard filled with animal statues, vases, fountains, and all kinds of little decorations. i didn't want to take a picture as that felt a little too creepy. 2:22 pm| i set my new location and generated the 3rd attractor. at this point i was kind of in a hurry because i had to head to a job orientation in about 30 minutes. the radius was still 3000 and the power was 3.15. ~2:30 pm| on the way to the attractor was a public park i had never seen before. it had very colorful play sets with flowery designs and almost looked psychedelic, i may be bias though. this one was quite close, and led me to another neighborhood, this one with a much more interesting vibe to it. all the houses were very nice, and it was a very nature-filled quiet peaceful neighborhood just at the bottom of a hill. almost all the houses looked very well kept-after with incredible garden designs and plant life everywhere. there were a few houses that looked bland and plain in comparison with yellow lawns and un-kept nature. the attractor landed on one of these houses and had a small ""rickity"" fence surrounding the yard. again, i would have loved to take a picture but i just didn't feel right doing so. one interesting thing that happened as i was leaving this neighborhood area was a small sedan that looked similar to my own car turned on their hazards and slowly pulled to the side of the road as i drove passed."
confirming my theory about random actions of yours not being random.,2019-06-23,"(posted it on r/glitch_in_the_matrix before) so i think it's a time to tell you about the second coincidence on my list. it was a like 4 months ago, i had a reddit account, but only to go there and upvote some memes. (didn't know about this sub reddit also). i installed a game on my phone "" stronghold kingdoms"" , and if you familiar with it , you know that at the beginning there is a possibility to choose a village on the world map manually or randomly. so i choose a random location and game gives me a village in the region of shiraz. (a city in iran). the same day i choose to visit reddit . and this is what i see in my feed immediately i open it. http://imgur.com/gallery/dtgfz8m. the post in r/pics which shows a mosque in shiraz what are the odds of this coincidence? idk, but seemed to me like a wierd thing. i have never seen any shiraz related posts on reddit since."

first randonaut experience,2019-06-23,it was a rainy day and i really wanted to try it out. i had a 2.89 attractor right at the all girls school my sister is going to. i never really payed attention to it. my sister insisted on going so we walked there in the rain. my sisters mood started acting up but we continued to patrol. i thought there were some odd idiosyncrasies put it was probably in my head. the point was right beyond this fence on the track. there were 3 robins there. on my way back we found a dead one. one weird coincidence is that my dad did his first experience yesterday and it took him to a historic all boys school yesterday. any randonaut experts that can help me explain this meaning. thanks.

nothing is set in stone,2019-06-23,"this isn't a field report. i feel compelled to document some of that changes that have occurred in my life since i began my journey with fatum\_bot. i was stuck in a very dark place. i had been feeling like the walls were closing in, on all levels - personal and professional. the first big change that is occurring in my life is related to my work - that professional level. the company i work for has been undergoing major corporate restructuring, and this week all the realignment was due to trickle down to my level. i would be transferred into a new department, along with the 1 other guy i work with, and placed under the supervision of a different manager. my whole world at work was about to be turned upside down. last week, one of the new corporate guys was in town, taking a tour of our office and specifically my workspace. as he concluded his inspection and was about to leave, i held the door open for him and said, ""this place is like wonderland, isn't it?"" (a joke because my workspace is ridiculously small for the amount of equipment and boxes i have, stuff is piled everywhere.) the next day, there was a company-wide teleconference to reveal the new department alignments. to my amazement, i was to remain exactly where i was, still working for my old boss. i was and still am absolutely elated!!! i didn't think this was even a possibility. everyone was blindsided, apparently this was an eleventh hour reversal by the new corporate guys, specifically the fellow who had been touring my office earlier in the week. even the managers had no idea corporate had changed their minds about this. granted, like the title of my post says, nothing is set in stone... all the paperwork will be signed off on tomorrow, supposedly, to make it all official-official. but there have been, shall we say, consequences. i recall doing things, recent things, that suddenly haven't actually happened. for example, at work, i remember shipping some equipment to a certain field tech, because he had requested it. come to find out, it was a completely different person who requested the stuff, and i ""shipped it to the wrong person,"" a mistake i have never made before. i remember things differently and specifically, but that's not how they happened. this isn't me mis-remembering, either. there have been other changes, too. slight personality shifts in people. things not being the way i left them, or being gone completely. possibly even past events changing, i'm still not fully sure. all small, recent things - i have to emphasize, nothing major. i'm no longer in that dark place i was a week ago. i feel like someone lost in the woods who has finally emerged into a large clearing, a field. still surrounded by trees and lost, but arriving at an oasis of sunshine and clarity. where i go next, i will have to choose carefully. if you are still reading, i would encourage some level of caution on your randonauting adventures. specifically, be careful what you wish for - you may get it and then some."

first randonaut trip,2019-06-25,"for a long time, i've felt trapped in my loop. same things, everyday on the same schedule. today, i was at my job listening to a podcast (this one - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8cjiltlym) and the guest started talking about the randonauts subreddit. it was the first time i had heard about it. so for the rest of the day, i read up on the fatum project, downloaded telegram, and decided to give it a try. these are the notes on my first trip. my first attractor point was in the parking lot of a local grocery store, that i have been to many times. i went there and parked my car. i got out for a few minutes and walked around and tried to pay attention. the only notable thing i think i could see, was an orange traffic cone which seemed to be in the exact spot of the attactor point. i snapped a photo and got back in the car to request a 2nd point. the 2nd attractor point was in a neighborhood a few miles away. the point seemed to be in the back yard of a house. i parked the car, and walked around the block, but didn't want to stand in front of the house or take any photos of the property. i didn't really seem to find anything important there, so i requested another point. the 3rd attractor point was in another neighborhood in a different part of town. this neighborhood was a little nicer than the last, and the new point was on the corner of the street, next to a drive way. i got out and walked around the block again, trying to pay extra attention to everything going on. it was a nice day out, so there were people out walking dogs, so i didn't try to hang out in any certain spot. just went for a nice walk in a place i had never been before. i decided to request 1 more point before going back home. the 4th attactor point was in another neighborhood close by, this one was the nicest of them all so far. this point was located on a walking trail that when through the neighborhood, located in some brush. there was a small patch of orange flowers that seemed to be separated from anything else around it. i was very nice and peaceful back there. no one would have ever known about that spot, if they didn't know how to look for it. overall, it was an interesting experience, and if nothing else, got me out of the apartment for a little while. i'll try doing it again soon, and will continue to record my results. let me know if you have any tips for me."

when an attractor sets on fire a month later,2019-06-25,"i'm pretty much a lurker on esoteric subreddits (have used another handler since 2011.) that being said, i felt compelled to try randonauting and join the telegram chat. it seemed like a fun way to get out of the house and explore. i recently moved far away from home, so i haven't had much time to go on another randonauting adventure since my last journey i'll share in this post. knowing i'd be leaving the philadelphia area, i decided to give randonauting the old college try to see what is was all about. figured at a minimum, it would be a harmless way to get out of the house and say goodbye to philly. on this trip, i ended up trying to go to three different attractors, though only successfully found one. my first attractor site was among a large void space, covered in many trees that i pretty much never knew existed. however, as you'll see in the album-- a pile of tired and trash, coupled with poor shoes (dumb on me) and despair meme prevented me from heading over. still curious what that 8.0 attractor was... my second attractor led me to the philadelphia energy solutions-- the largest oil refinery on the eastern seaboard of the united states. again, i was not able to navigate to the actual attractor, due to the security surrounding the refinery and a barbed wire fence i didn't feel like trying to climb over. ;) well to my surprise, just this past friday-- the refinery erupted inflames. i no longer live in the city, but friends and news reports confirm that their apartments rattled. [the early morning sky went from black to orange.](https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/c38li8/boom/) i know it may just be a *coincidence*...but i also know many of you are not too fond of that word. regardless, considering i was never even aware of the plant's existence---and now it's on national news is something to be said. last but not least-- the third attractor i found (a 2.68?) was also pretty cool! let me to a brick wall with a cool symbol from water. saw a lot of interesting graffiti on the way there, a black cat that seemed like it was guarding the area-- and a weird abandon van with a message i can't decipher. let me know what you think it says!

fast food adventure,2019-06-26,"&amp;#x200b; *processing img ofu8y3fogm631...* i've been so stinkin' busy with house stuff and work i haven't had much time for randonauting lately. tonight, i finally had a chance, despite being pretty tired. i hadn't really eaten all day except for some peanut butter crackers and lots of coffee, so as my point was being generated, i had food on the brain. i had set the radius for 8000 meters from my home, and got an attractor with a power level of 2.42. now, this here might be the most important takeaway from this post - the point was generated across the street from a wendy's, along the way to a friend's house i had been to earlier today and was thinking about! even though i had already been out that way today, i decided to go ahead and go there for food. the exact point was actually generated directly over the hq/main warehouse of a local hot dog company - this is what you see in the photo at the top of this post, i snapped that picture while sitting at a stoplight just before the wendy's. the 2nd attractor point i ever generated was right next to another warehouse owned by this same company ([https://www.reddit.com/r/randonauts/comments/c0s7pd/497\_attractor\_some\_sort\_of\_antenna/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/randonauts/comments/c0s7pd/497_attractor_some_sort_of_antenna/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)). i've been eating their hot dogs a lot lately and yesterday finished off the last from the big bag i've had in my fridge. i got to the restaurant just in time, a line of half a dozen cars pulled in behind me. i ordered my food, got it, and headed back home. i thought about doing an attractor chain, but i was hungry and i had also gotten food for my wife. arrived back home, was feeling good, went to grab my food, and much to my dismay i discovered that i received the wrong food. my wife's food was correct, but mine was not. i was going to just have the fries and call it a night, but my wife would have none of that! she insisted on either driving all the stinkin' way back out there (about 15 minutes away) or going to another place to get food for me. i didn't want her to do the latter and as such, we got the food, hopped back in the car and went back to wendy's! the staff there was cool and took care of us, made us fresh food and we got a free dessert out of it! it probably helped that we were very polite to them, rather than getting mad at them. apparently they were short staffed - understandable. i hope the staff there had a calm rest of their night and get a chance to relax a bit now. i snapped the below photo from the wendy's parking lot; this is looking directly out over the attractor point, from a different angle than my first photo: &amp;#x200b; *processing img vcpxel9wgm631...* as we were waiting for our food, my wife commented on how weird it was that the fatum\_bot would take me all the way out here, to a place where my order got screwed up, especially when there is another wendy's closer to home. she speculated that maybe the bot was just trying to get her to go out there with me. it was, actually, her first time going to an attractor point with me. after we had our food, i decided to generate another point, there in the parking lot as my location, radius still 8000 meters. i was hoping maybe my wife and i could go out on an adventure... instead, we got a point (2.98) in the middle of a park that is best known for a rape that occurred there years ago. that ended that and we returned home! in a way, it was also my first time taking an artifact from an attractor point... but those artifacts are as of this writing digesting in my stomach."
first quantum location with first artifact found,2019-06-26,"spawned my first /getquantum. the point of this isn't to find an attractor point, it was to test what the quantum function would generate in terms of blind spots around my home environment. it was [slightly off a track &amp; road i've walked before](https://imgur.com/1b4yhgi) (blue line = familiar. red = new to me. note the red mark on the road is where i found the toy/artifact). on arrival, the location was [in the back field of a home](https://imgur.com/nwljy8m). discovered a few years back that this property belongs to the parents of a classmate i knew 15 years ago at school. it's a small insignificant thing because the odds of spawning a quantum point there probably isn't unlikely. after that i [checked out the lake](https://imgur.com/kbst58b) and spawned another getquantum which showed a point within the lake (looked like some swans in that direction) then left for home. outside the front of their property i [found a small beetle toy](https://imgur.com/u0y7drj) in the gravel alongside the road. pocketed that and continued thinking it insignificant. nearing the end of the walk i was thinking about leaving it on a fence-post under a mug that has been sitting on a fence-post for the past many years. but on inspecting the toy i discover [the wings can be opened](https://imgur.com/afvtliu) and inside was a fractal lens [that would create a multiverse-like illusion](https://imgur.com/z6dunah). after reading a story or two here about how their rando journeys took them to a point with a bunch of reflections, or the general idea of these journeys treading improbable pathways/locations; finding this toy is maybe a weird coincidence. it reminds me of ant-mans journey into the quantum realm so i like to call the illusion just that, especially in relation to the quantum point. very cool. in other news, i had 15 minutes to check out a void last night. it put me in a grassed farm field. night sky overhead with plenty of stars. stayed there for 5 minutes before leaving. as i'm heading up this hillside, i have sight of the stars and see this reasonably large meteor cross the sky. i'm talking graze the atmosphere fireball size. wouldn't have seen it had i not taken the journey :-)"

report of first experience properly using the bot.,2019-06-27,"okay i'll preface this with some info. this is my first time properly using the bot. i've searched for attractors etc but never actually went there. so cut to today. weather is brilliant and i have a day off. i packed my water and went for a walkabout. i started off with the fatum bot but had the randonaut bot as a back up. ( glad i did.). my first attractor point took me to a woodland area behind some factories. the fact it pointed to there fascinated me as a lot of weird shit has happened there, the place is a local talk point. anyway i came about the usual things. first i got a bit lost finding the exact spot. as i became frustrated and sure enough some 'npc's' appeared and i approached them to ask them the way. they showed me a spot were the security fence had a hole and i could easily access my destination. now i have to mention that a few days ago i was diagnosed with labyrinthitis. it's a shitty thing to have and wouldn't wish it on anyone. i was feeling great until i reached the spot. started to feel really dizzy. vision went and i felt sick. i chalked this down to the infection and took some pics then moved on. immediately after i left i felt better again. coincidence? didn't find anything interesting except for an [old dish towel ](https://imgur.com/gallery/jq8eeqy) (rag). checked it for blood or something strange but nothing. so i moved on and generated another spot. this time it took me closer to another factory and i basically tresspassed to get to the point. i bumped into a security guard who seemed very shocked i was there. made up a story about my missing cat with gps collar and i was looking for it. he helped me and showed me how to access the exact spot. all i saw was a huge [metal structure ](https://imgur.com/gallery/d5iarfj) that was maybe a industrial fridge? this was behind a confectionary factory. spoke to workers who were smoking weed and chilling out round the back. had a cool discussion with them but nothing else stood out so i moved on. this is were it got interesting. i generated another attractor point which led me to another woodland area about a mile away. i've been this way before so knew where to go but the exact point was in an awkward area to get to. i met some teenage girls who where drinking alcohol and i asked them if they had seen a cat and showed them the gps point. they told me i didn't need to walk the long way as there was a broken fence that led to a path. so i went that way. at the exact location i was led to there was a shady junkie (drug addict) talking to another teenage girl and it looked like he was forcing her to drink a bottle of buckfast (a potent alcoholic and caffeine tonic wine popular with jakies in my area.) i immediately knew she was in danger and shouted at the guy and asked him wtf he was up to. on seeing me he panicked and ran away. i spoke to the girl and made sure she was okay. she was really weird with me and refused to let me call the police for her. i offered her my phone to call her parents and she told me she had none. she lives with her gran who is in hospital right now. so i asked her if she wanted me to walk her home. she said no as her friends were waiting for her. (the girls i mentioned previously). i tried to ask her what happened and what that guy was about. she refused to answer. so i walked back with her in front of me. i showed her where her friends were and told her friends to look after her and take care. ""fuck off mister."" they replied. charming. so off i fucked. not before i called the police and reported the whole story ( not what led me there) and gave them a description of the girl and the creepy dude. cops asked for my details etc so i gave them. they said they would get back to me. so by this time i was slightly frazzled and honestly felt like i was in a game and everyone i met were npcs either helping me or stopping me from my quests. weird i know. i took a slight break and contemplated what was happening. this bit is fucking so bizarre yet so fascinating. i don't believe the airy fairy nonsense but fuck is it hard to ignore. i then received a call from an unknown number. it was a social worker asking about this girl. she's been missing for days and they were looking for her. i gave them all the info i gave to police. she thanked me and said i did the right thing. this made me feel a lot better. i asked if she could let me know if the girl is okay when they find her, but i was told i wouldn't be contacted further. which was fine, i felt i did my bit. after a short rest i generated a quantum spot. this spot was again in a woodland area behind a shopping centre and close to a railway. slightly awkward to get to as it wanted me to cross a railway. i eventually managed to take a longer way round and found lots of rabbits and an [eerie tunnel](https://imgur.com/gallery/wcgtukx)in a canal. the only other thing of interest was [helium balloon ](https://imgur.com/gallery/a4aaqj6) stuck in a tree. on walking back i noticed the graffiti on the side of the bridge. the word that stood out was: [maze!](https://imgur.com/gallery/wy3gl78) now of all the stuff that happened today that freaked me out the most for some reason. that's when i called it a day and decided to go home. i ended up having a few pints of guinness at my local and told others about the bot. just got home and i'm trying to process my adventure. whether you believe in the reasons behind this app is irrelevant. it gets you outside and sends you on adventures no matter what you believe. love this app and the community. i can't wait to hear more stories from around the world. let me know what you think as i've had a weird day!"

delayed intention-results; breaking the stasis field compels a procrastinator to act!,2019-06-28,"about two or three weeks ago i found this sub, and i set off on a series of attractor chains for a good solid week. saw some interesting things, aligning with the patterns of this sub, but nothing particularly groundbreaking in terms of talking walls and results of intentions. i picked up trash as suggested, and when i couldnt find trash i picked up small pieces of wood/sticks. my thought was, even if the artifact wasnt significant to the intentions i set directly before, at least i could use it to convince myself to clean out my car by allowing several points worth of trash to contribute to the mess. this thought was apparently more attributed to the attractors than i had thought, as im turning a crucial corner in life where preparation is key...im getting ready for college, and i need to clean up my belongings so i can function properly as an independent adult. so fast forward to earlier yesterday: i had announced to my dad that i was done with my paperwork for college and the next step (as planned) was to clean out my car. now, im a big procrastinator, intentions play a big part in my actions already. i have to really focus my energy on the process and preparation of something in order to do it. and honestly, i wouldve most definitely found excuses to put off the decluttering... but right after i announced to my dad that now was probably a good time to declutter, i went out to my car to grab something, and lo and behold i found a small ant. and then another. i started squashing them, and i moved the artifacts on my passenger seat and right underneath the small piece of wood, i found a shit ton of ants. they were swarming into a giant living, breathing cluster. disgusting. so i killed em all (naturally). dont ask me how...but i killed them with a tissue and i immediately cleaned out my entire car to ensure there werent any places for them to hide. i wish the butterfly effect could be measured. who knows what effects this will have on my future! ive gained at least two more weeks to pack and prepare, as im done with this step (step 3) two weeks ahead of this procrastinators schedule. im positive this will allow me to organize and prepare better for this next journey in life, quite potentially giving me a leg up mentally and academically. so it appears that, through an intention with an unforeseen significance, and through attractor trash that apparently retains potency over time, the stasis field was disrupted in such a way to compel my intentions to become reality. the series of deterministic variables in my life were altered, almost literally forcing my reality to change. who knew a simple wood chip could harbor a few ants that multiplied into two hundred? probably a lot of people, im common-sense stupid. but hey, these attractors allowed me to pick up something i wouldnt have normally picked up, exposing my lack of common sense, that wouldnt have otherwise been exposed. and forced my plans to manifest... at the right time, nonetheless. any joe on the street would see this as a gross meaningless story that is, at best, a synchronicity. but when you look at how the deterministic variables of a life were observably altered by a quantum attractor, suddenly it becomes apparent that its not just a cool coincidence but rather a small affirmation for a groundbreaking experiment."

let's rock,2019-07-03,"had a nice, short little trek tonight. using randonaut\_bot (aka the backup one), i set my home as my location and the radius to 3000 meters. i generated an attractor point of 5.60, right between the local high school and an eye doctor's office. it took all of about 5 minutes to drive to the point; i parked in the optometrist's parking lot and was able to walk directly to the spot. nothing significant stood out to me, other than the fact that it is yet another gorgeous, sunny evening here and it was nice to be outside. i didn't want to stick around too long, as there is no reason for anyone to just be hanging out on school property like that. i set my location there at the point and on the way back to the car, i noticed a rock which had probably once been part of the parking lot but had broken off. i took it with me, as it was the only obvious artifact in the area that stuck out to me. &amp;#x200b; *processing img l40c10woez731...* i generated my next attractor point. randonaut\_bot really wanted me to tempt fate and go directly in the middle of the runways at our city airport for a weak attractor point (1.73). not wanting to go to prison, and happy with my artifact, i decided to just head home. nothing special or crazy, but for the time being i have a pet rock, so there's that."

first mission was.... weird?,2019-07-14,"[weird pics](https://imgur.com/gallery/wuwv7w5) i had a bit of an issue with being led to private property. i did a total of 4. but lets start at the beginning. let me start by saying that my freakin keys were stuck in my unit door on the outside when i went to leave. i could have been in a potential danger had i not noticed this, and wouldnt have known if i hadnt planned this little jaunt. when i got to my car, the navigation apps were all missing from the display. the pictures tell the story. additionally, collected a crumpled up piece of sheet music in addition to two liquor store receipts. the paths drove me twice past the same van that had personal significance (logo) wasnt aware this company that i used to work for even had logo vans. the sunset was beautiful. i arrived at destination #5 just as dusk emerged. an open gate with a sign that said armenian cemetery....? yikes. this was in an alley, next to a vacant lot where there appeared to be people living in camper type vans with the pop-up ceilings. i decided to call it a night. overall, very fun experience. cant wait to do it again."

first trip and i am greeted by a swarm of birds,2019-07-14,"i discovered the randonaut sub reddit this morning. i decided to go on a trip today which is very unlike me, i am one to find interest in something but then delay actually doing it until much later. anyways the bot led me to a attraction point very close to my house. but the spot was in the middle of the highway on the train tracks (i live in chicago in the train runs between both lanes of the highway at some points). ive walked along the road on the north side of the highway many times, but never the south. so i decide to walk along the road south of the point and get as close as i can to it. before leaving i tried to take deep breaths and let my mind wander freely. i tried to remember anything that stood out and i remembered thinking about ducks. the spot was only about a four minute walk away from my house. as i got closer to the spot i started looking around for anything i noticed that directly where the spot was on the train tracks there was some sort of electrical box for the train, and on the street close to the spot was a really big blue landscaping truck. i thought it was cool that the spot was highlighted but nothing crazy so far. then as soon as i get to the closest i can get to the spot from the street next to the highway a black bird with red wings comes and flies to a pole right in front of me and starts squawking. it was the first time i had noticed (heard/seen) and bird on the walk so far. birds have always sort of freaked me out so i was initially kind of spooked. i think about leaving but then remember i should try not to be fearful on these trips. i decided to stay and within seconds the bird circles my head coming about 3 feet above me squawking the whole time. 10 more seconds pass and four more birds come in theyre all circling my head and squawking sometimes coming within a foot from my head. meanwhile an airplane passes over and a train passes by. i start walking faster trying to avoid a bird attack but also trying to see what the hell is going on. during this whole time two or three cars had come really close to hitting me when passing me. most likely due to the fact that i was aimlessly wandering the street looking for anything of significance, but it gave me the same vibe that the birds were giving me, which was that i was not expected to be here. also along this road a car had its blinker going left, but then turns right into a parking lot and abruptly stops . this car and the fact that the road was a dead end cause me to turn around and start walking back home as i walked past the spot the birds kept squawking and circling my head. as soon as i was farther from the spot i turned around the birds were nowhere to be found and you couldnt hear any squawking. im sorry this is so long. this is my first time posting on reddit. i dont meditate often and my expectations were super low for my first trip. but this was way more than i had expected! i have videos of the birds and the trip. im not sure if there any specific rules on what kind of videos i can post. im talking in it and i sometime use profanity (lol the bird were terrifying!!) and my face is in parts of it."
"first time - 2.00 then 3.55 attractors, ducks!",2019-07-15,"so, this was my very very first fatum. party of three: my gf, my dog and myself. radius of 1000, generated attractors from my place (northern paris, france). first one was a 1.72, so i ignored it, generated a second, exactly 2.00, at a corner i walk by every day when walking my dog. figuring i wouldnt find a blind spot there, i set the radius to 2000 and generated yet another point. got a 3.55 in a little park i did not know existed in a general area i never go to. so we headed out there, and since the 2.00 was on the way, stopped there anyway. my neighbourhood is full of pretty neat street art, and this particular corner has a lot of it; i only paid attention to things that were not here or that i didnt notice the last time around. two things stood out to me at the time: a big, green-and-yellow fuck le 17 graffiti, and a nice piece with a black-haired woman with a lizard tattoo within a hand, somewhat ripped off (though im almost sure it was made very recently). as i was taking pictures being weird, my gf was a few steps back, received a text, and wrote back. next to the black-haired woman, there was a tiny, doodle-like thing with what i thought was a duck, that was also new to me. i did not bother taking a picture of that. as we started walking toward the 2nd point again - i was paying close attention to the tats of every person we crossed path with, especially if they were black-haired - my gf happily explained that the text she received was a picture of her niece playing in a small inflatable pool. we kept walking, talking about lizard tattoos and paying more attention than usual to all the street art (this alone made this trip so worthwhile). at some point, my gf goes hey, there wasnt anything duck-related on that corner was there? i immediately stop and, wondering for a second if shes messing with me, ask her why? before telling her about the doodle on the wall. my niece, she says, she was playing with a little plastic duck in the picture. i tell her about the doodle; we contemplate going back (subtle despair meme?) so i can show her, but eventually decide to keep going and pass by the corner on the way back instead. the 3.55 was in a small park with a playground. the weather was amazing that afternoon, so tons of parents watching tons of kids playing. it was forbidden to dogs, so my gf and doggie waited at the entrance while i went in to check out the point. it was beyond a fenced-off area, with thicker trees and bushes, where a big building was. i hesitated a little, looked around, then went over the fence and toward the building (it was one of those very small, maybe like 50-80cm high fences). on the face of the building was another tag, black and red, that read (to me) snip vivi 1703 (remember the first point had a fuck le 17). i took a picture, picked up some trash. i also picked up a pigeon feather that was pretty close to the point - not the most exciting artefact, but ah. overall a really nice time. my gf was pretty skeptical at first, tbh i think she mostly came along just cause she felt this was important to me and maybe even to keep an eye on me somewhat, but she really got into it and its like the whole thing really made us feel this like, wave of happiness. especially when we realized the duck thing! again, even if nothing else, just walking around paying so much more attention to our surroundings - it would be enough to make it totally worth it. were definitely going for more. ill keep an eye out for 17s i guess (not a number of any significance to me that i can think of). and if my gfs niece ever gets a lizard tattoo well freak the fuck out :) its gonna be a while though, shes like 2 or something atm. pics: [duck](https://imgur.com/mlmxlqe) - on the way back, my gf said it might be a chick and not a duck, which i guess is fair enough. i definitely thought ""duck"" when i first saw it though, right as she was receiving the pic.

what we've learned so far and where we are going,2019-07-17,"fatum-1 (pseudorandom points are sent to random people) 1. does stasis field exist? - probably yes, at least at memetic level (people resisted to participate) 2. can deviations from stasis pattern cause anomalies - probably. some anomalies were noticed. fatum-2 (telegram bot with attractors and quantum randomness) 1. do blind spots exist? - yes, at least personal blind-spots. 1.a do collective blind-spots exist, where no one has ever been? - still unknown. 2. do void memes work? - definitely yes. and they strong enough to overcome memetic stasis. 2.a does randonauting change perception? - attention increase noticed. 3. are there anomalies in attractor points? - a lot of synchronicities found. 3.a whats the difference between attractors and voids? - still unknown. 3.b is reality-tunnel deviation cumulative? (attractors chains) - results unclear. 3.c are there long term causal consequences of randonauting? - probably. 3.d can we use attractors to search/manifest things or events? - still unknown. but the ""owl experiment"" shows positive result and intentions interconnectedness. fatum-3 (improved ida (intention driven anomalies) search engine on telegram bot) 1. does one-intention generated ida have something in common? 1.a how exactly intention affects ida. 2. do effects of points remain, while separated from researchers expectations (blind experiments) 2.a is talking walls effect a void-memetic perception bias? 3. what territory ida covers? fatum-4 (android app based platform with multi-dimensional ida search) 1. how long ida lives? 2. whats happening in the life of an ida? 3. whats the real power of an ida based on its lifetime. &amp;#x200b; new features are being ported into the upgraded fatum-bot, that will be able to beta test some time in august."

first attractor point adventure 3.05,2019-07-22,"so this was my first experience today- muddled through and got the app working, generated a 3.05 point close to my workplace, i had to run errands for work in the car so it was a good opportunity to have a stickybeak. i was disappointed to see the point was actually near the boundary fence between 2 houses, so it was private property and i probably wouldnt be able to get to the exact point. drove to the address and parked the car - as expected the point was halfway down a driveway, near the fence. the street was completely deserted but i didnt feel comfortable walking down the driveway. couldnt see anything of interest from the footpath. decided to walk about 20 metres up the path, then turned back, thinking about what to do. as i approached the house again, there was now a woman standing at the exact point, with a mobility walker and heaps of shopping bags. i was taken aback as she hadnt been there 30 seconds ago. i slowed down, made eye contact, and heard myself asking her if she wanted some help with her bags - she laughed a little, said no, thank you - i was going to ask if you needed any help? i laughed as well, said no, im fine, thank you and got straight back in the car! genuinely surprised and more than a little delighted by the experience"

first trip today and it was certainly a trip,2019-07-23,"i decided to set my first attractor today at the same moment i turned on my scheduled shift for work. the point was set about 10 minutes away from me in a pretty busy area right on the street outside a chipotle. so i decided to drive out there that moment and check it out. &amp;#x200b; when i arrived, i walked around a bit to make sure i was in the right spot. luckily, there was no one really around so i decided to explore a little bit. i notice a mall and parking lot across the street, and on my side was mostly parking lot and the chipotle. after a few minutes of walking i decided that it was just a normal busy street with nothing special to offer. i walked back to the area where the attractor was supposed to be, which was slightly off the curb and into the street just a bit. i stood there for a moment and my phone started going off. i forgot i was working (delivery driver) and a order had finally came in. i live in a busy area, so it was unusual how much time i had to drive there and walk around before an order came in. i put my phone in my pocket and looked up one more time and the giant words bed bath and beyond were on the side of the mall facing the street, and for some reason the beyond bit had me stopped in place. in the moment i connected that to life, death, and what is beyond. those were thoughts i certainly wasn't thinking about at the time. something about seeing that word felt like that was what i was supposed to see, so i head to pick up that order. &amp;#x200b; once i marked the order as ""picked up"" the customers address popped up. i realized i was delivering to a hospital. on arrival i notice i'm heading to the the nursing home section around back. i head in and follow the instructions down many hallways to the room number. the entire atmosphere was just sadness and pain in there. a women in one of the rooms cried ""help me help me"" over and over when i passed by her. i found the room i was delivering to and in the bed was a bone thin, terribly sick woman. i asked her name and if the food was for her and she could not even respond or nod. this woman was clearly very close to death and as i thanked her and walked out i had a realization that the beyond moment may have actual meaning. the connection gave me a strange sense of safety that there is a beyond for this woman, and for us all. whatever that may be. &amp;#x200b; i stood outside for a while and let the sun warm me back up. i could simply be overthinking the entire thing, but the whole moment felt connected. even if it wasn't, it certainly was a huge trip to experience."

(catholic) as i go to mass every sunday and pray every night. over the past few weeks i have prayed harder and more often given the circumstances. i have been wondering if i am making the right decision by waiting for my ex and not moving on right away while remaining supportive and friendly in her times of need. back to the first trip now. i was feeling down before about and just wanted some confirmation that i am doing the right things, that everything will work out and it will be okay. the location was about 2.1 miles away from work and driving there i had a calming sense that whatever happens will happen, whether i find a real attractor or not. i had no expectations but more of a general curiosity of what could be. as i got within a few hundred feet of the location it seemed to be in the middle of some woods of a small but populated road and my heart sank. i wouldnt have anywhere to park and im not about to trek through some deep woods on my break. so i approach the spot on my left and see just a few feet ahead is an entrance to some sort of facility. and it just happens to be a catholic charities facility with all buildings named after saints. my heart started pounding, i started to get chills. i couldnt believe out of all the places it took me too was a catholic facility as i mentioned early i am catholic and particle regularly. also been praying diligently looking for confirmation of my actions and thoughts. and here is the kicker. the main building the first one that i noticed when i read the sign was for mental health services. basically the issues that caused the break up between my ex and myself. i couldnt believe i ended up there and two signs touching a very sensitive spot in my life that i am going through in multiple aspects.

"first attempt: four attractors, two synchronicities and one success.",2019-07-24,"took this for a spin on my lunch break. thought i'd try as many as i could squeeze in and got to four. i used /getattractor primarily and tried /getvoid but found only weak types, too far, and inaccessible. the first three attractors i visited (didn't visit every location i input command for, many were inaccessible) were partially inaccessible but i figured i might find something in the area. **first location:*unsuccessful* pin in someone's backyard. front yard had three rabbits, brown, black, and white. very unique garden sculpture on opposite street but i didn't snap a picture. **second location:** *mild synchronicity* - someone was doing landscaping work at this address' front yard so i didn't stop. there were three small white statues in the front yard, marking this mild synchronicity with previous location. **third location**: *synchronicity* - pin was behind a fence and in the backyard of the house on the adjacent street. i pulled up to the dead end (two locations at dead ends, for what it's worth, but there's a lot of those in this area), pulled a u-turn, and parked for a spell. while i sat there a boy came down the road directly in front of me (he was coming at me) on a go-kart! nice synchronicity here! i went go-karting for the first time in ages three days ago (sunday) and had such a blast. i bought a membership and everything. i've had it on my mind so much i was watching a video of a go-kart race right before leaving for lunch! **fourth location**: *success* - fatum took me out of the residential neighborhood and into the industrial. ended up by some warehouses reading a sign in front of the parking lot nearest the attractor that said ""no trespassing"". i parked there anyway and spotted four tables arranged for outdoor lunching. good enough for me so i jumped out of the car and started walking over. soon as i rounded the corner i spotted these guys: [imgur](https://imgur.com/u3easxi) (you can see the second one in the background)! can't believe fatum directed me, randomly, to some extremely out of place plastic wolves. attractor level: 2.27 can't wait to experiment with this some more. note: minor glitch uploading the pictures, imgur failed upload of all three pictures (one album) on first attempt."

my first randonaut journey was yesterday.,2019-07-24,"might have overdone it, as i did 6. two different 3 trip sessions. a friend of mine introduced me to the subreddit and i barely even looked here before downloading telegram and heading out since i love things of this nature. throughout these journeys, i was in contact with my friend who was either also searching around or was watching videos of other people's stories. for my first 2 trips, i did not select an attractor point. i did \_\_ first and then quantum for the second. i honestly do not know the difference between the options yet. all trips 3-6 were all allocator points, reset at each location. the first location i arrived at was in a gated neighborhood very close to my house. i turned onto a long street that led to the open entrance gate. there were no cars in sight so i felt strange about going straight into the gated area. the gate remained open as i drove up to it, but i second-guessed myself, fearing many things, one of which was my car getting hit by the closing gate. after a moment, i decided i would park and walk through, so i drove around the roundabout to park, the location i parked was very close but i was facing the opposite direction. when i turned to the gate it was closed. so, sadly, i had missed my opportunity because i couldn't find another way in. i reset and headed off to my second journey which leads me to a very long residential street. as i got closer to the location, i started feeling uneasy. i felt as if everyone was aware of what i was doing... note: i had not read about the despair meme until after all of the journeys for the day. i drove slowly down the street to locate the house that was marked. it was an rv decked out in a universities emblems. out front of the house, a man was sitting in his car, just staring forward. i feel that i need to add that it seemed that many people were suddenly appearing on the street. many were coming out of their houses and it felt like a delayed scene where everyone has to get to their places. since i was feeling too uncomfortable, i just drove through, without getting out, reset location and set off for an attractor. this was my first attractor of the day. 2.98 i spoke out my intentions as i drove to the location, that i would find something to expand my consciousness or something that would click with a future adventure. it led me to another neighborhood, all-white houses, that type. i thought i was being led to a house again, but slightly hidden behind some foliage was a staircase that led up a tall hill. i parked my car, passed a truck with a large 7 on it (my numerology number i had learned the day before), smiled, and continued to the stairs. i was now on a dog walking/hiking trail apparently for the marshlands in that area. i climbed for maybe 3 minutes before reaching the peak. suddenly, tons of dragonflies started moving and flying around. the first i noticed on the journey. i was in awe as i looked around and my world started to feel like i was alone, but not in a scary or bad way. just, comfortably alone. i talked with the dragonflies and observed them. i read the information about the marshlands and continued down the hike until there were too many spiders \^\^ the friend i had mentioned previously messaged me while i was there to inform me that people say things like snakes, owls, or dragonflies are signs people encounter on these trips. i took that as the sign i was looking for and i decided to take some videos to try and capture them but none of the clips really show how many were around me. the attractor was actually behind the fencing in the video you see, so i decided to not pursue it to its exact spot. i think this post is long enough so i'll write a little about the other trips another time. hopefully, i'll become better and writing about these adventures in the future. &amp;#x200b; ![video](xqq6bdsylac31 ""a few dragonfly friends can be seen "")"

question about theory,2019-07-25,"i have a question. im honestly trying not to bash this subreddit at all, but am seriously curious about the theories that are being discussed here and would like to have a better understanding of what it means and why its important. so heres my understanding (please let me know if i misrepresent anything here): in this theory, essentially theres a construct of reality where every action is predetermined from another action (whether positive or negative). in this case, this construct of reality is therefore indicating that free will doesnt exist or only exists in our perspectives. the theory then states, that, if we leverage true randomness, created through quantum physics, we can then exceed the limitations of the constructs of reality. this is through moving through space and time in order to physically exceed the limitations. while exceeding the limitations, then it might cause a disruption and possibly physically move you into an alternate timeline, where you still exist as yourself but a newer self. this brings me to my question. if this was all told in a more boiled down way, wouldnt this also be true: the constructs and limitations are our lives. when they become stagnant, then we are moving through the timeline we expect to exist. once we start moving and exceeding these limitations through going outside our comfort zones, then we change. therefore any change we encounter causes an alternate timeline, where you become a newer self, no quantum randomness needed. is this statement true for this theory? please school me and welcome any insight."

"new here, something strange happened and i'm kind of scared.",2019-07-25,"i've wanted to participate in the randonauts thing for a while. i was bored tonight and got an attractor point, knowing i probably wouldn't visit. i got my point, it was in a neighborhood i haven't been through. i looked up the point and clicked on the news section of google. two girls had been kidnapped at that same spot. right on the same corner of the street the bot had given me as a point. i'm shaking right now and i'm not sure what this means."
my first attractor point,2019-07-25,"so ive been on vacation this week and i discovered the fatum project. naturally i got sucked in lol. the first attractor point i received directed me to a lawrence road down the street from where im staying, interesting because back home i live off of a lawrence road. but it goes deeper, on either side of the point are two more roads. on one side michael ave and on the other, polly lane. i go by mike and my girlfriend (who im on vacation with) goes by polly... thoughts?"
this is such a good tool. clean report.,2019-07-25,"after my first time yesterday, i decided to start today off with another trip. i set an intention of a pot of gold, and went. first stop was a woman gardening just after passing small side road construction. next stop was a group of people cleaning out their garage, like pulling out the insulation with a rented dumpster outside style cleaning out. i was a bit from home so i set my current location to where i was and got the next point, it was the sidewalk at the end of what is essentially my driveway. not realizing the theme yet, i figured today was a bust, be it new and pretty scenery so i started home, past yet another group remodeling a garage, this time putting in insulation and plenty more people gardening. as a side note, my podcast was now talking about ""spiritual groundskeepers."" &amp;#x200b; stopped for a coffee on the way back, and two girls i don't believe i've ever seen were talking about them being out of straws, so i attempted to help them refill as it was busy, to limited success. once at the last point there seemed to be nothing there, but i was standing on top of the only trash around i could see, a piece being a plastic coffee cup. picked them up and just decided to walk it to the dumpster around the corner. those same two girls came up behind me and we ended up at the same place, they are my neighbors and i've never even seen them before. we didn't have a conversation, but all noticed the dumpster was a disaster, as if someone was angry at the world and emptied it into the parking lot. what stood out was how many straws were scattered around. &amp;#x200b; i just spent the last 40 minutes or so listening to music and cleaning up the area, and as i was finishing, there was a faded piece of newspaper that plainly said ""how was your experience?"" sitting next to a postcard with a message in a bottle on it. the song playing was ""earth day"" by devin townsend. also found a small golden squirrel that i took as an artifact, i've had a squirrel on my key chain for years that i lost not long ago."

to owls wy- my first attractor,2019-07-25,"power: 2.97 this was my first time randonauting (shangrila bot). i recognized the location because it was close to the road where my dads wake was a few months ago (a family friends house). i woke up at 7am and set off at around 8, alone in my car. i couldnt get into the exact location because it was far in the woods and i didnt feel safe going alone and leaving my car there, in between 2 driveways (i think). i came upon a crossroads a little after my gps told me to pull over, and in front of me was a road sign saying to owls wy. there was also a wood sign saying 787, and [road sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/b3s5uik)a small solar panel company sign saying, they chose the power of the sun! samesun of vermont samesunvt.com. on the road to the left there were 2 houses (1 driveway), 834 and 835. in the driveway was a cross looking mailbox hanger or something. on my way to a second location (near an old orchard on my road) i pulled over and saw a bunch of children geese, and someone on a tractor haying the fields.

""don't give up. you're worth it."" i started crying in my car as i drove. the exact location was in this beautiful horse-farming neighborhood, but i was getting weird looks and couldn't stay. this was also the second location i attracted that ended up in the water. on the way back, the signs said, ""one day at a time. keep going."" on the other side. i might go back for pictures, but the experience itself was enough for me. thank you fatum bot and the team behind it. and thank you for reading."

my first adventure.,2019-07-25,"i installed everything this afternoon. my first attractor point was impossible to get to. it was in the middle of the two separated lanes on a bridge. i was a bit amped up with adrenaline and excitement, so i went to the bike lane on the bridge and got parallel to the the point, maybe 50 feet away. i didn't do anything dangerous per se, but it isn't somewhere i would have gone on my own. i forgot to set a new location, so my next attractor point was from my original starting location. it was again inaccessible. it was in the middle of a block of apartments, probably their backyards. i got to about 90 feet away. here's where i started to attribute meaning to some of the things along the way, or at least they got me thinking. i passed my neighborhood's branch of the library, which i'd read about for years, but never gone to. i even signed up for a library card online, maybe 6 years ago. you have to confirm it in person, however, and i never went. made me start thinking about follow-through, and persistence, and grit, traits i don't have a lot of, and wish i did. i also want to be more of a reader/studier, but the lack of those traits don't help much either. passing the very pretty building made me wistful and want to sign up again. the second point was in a hasidic neighborhood, which i rarely travel through on foot. it makes me uncomfortable; i feel out of place there, like i'm invading private territory. i pushed on, and saw little shops i'd have never seen otherwise. i picked up a few pieces of garbage outside of the door of the apartment building in front of the attractor point. i got some sideways glances from a woman watching her kids play. i started to wander a little, and set a new starting location. i tried a void this time. the third point was accessible, but it was inside of a little used electronics store. this part of the neighborhood is mainly puerto rican, and this store was run by a puerto rican man. there were four or five other guys hanging outside of the store. there were two tvs outside playing the news, and one just inside the door. i felt out of place again, and didn't think i'd have the courage to go in. i hung outside watching the news for five or ten minutes, and walked away. i was a bit dejected, trying to bolster myself to go in. so i did, and asked if they had used ham radios. he did not know what i was talking about, but i think i got my point across when he showed me an old boom box and i explained i was looking for a two way radio. he said he'd call if he ever had one. it was hot, and i'd walked past two opened fire hydrants just at the right time, so i could cool myself. that was neat, but not out of the ordinary. since it was so hot, i was going to go home, but at the last second i thought i'd see how far away the next point might be. i set a new location and luckily the point was only a few blocks away. it was a barre/yoga studio. this is more my territory, so i went in and asked about schedules. i of course wouldn't have found this place otherwise. it looked kind of neat, i might take a class there. i tried the whole time to let myself be excited about adventure, but also not attribute meaning to things that would only seem meaningful because i was looking for meaning. on the other hand, though, maybe i should always be more open to meaningful interactions with other people and places, and it's a good attitude to have, that of having an adventure and trying new things. the biggest takeaway for me, at the moment, is pushing myself out of my social anxiety, even a little bit, which is a very good thing."

day 2 of randonauting,2019-07-26,"i posted a little about this in the randonaut lobby about the second adventure that i had yesterday. there was a little more to that day that i would like to share as i thought the synchronicities were cool. i had been having no luck with any locations this day. i was getting locations in water, the side of the freeway, down inaccessible trenches, etc. was close to giving up for the day but noticed that the next stop looked like a residential area, so i took the bait and ventured on. *power: 3.28.* as i entered the neighborhood and drove to my target, i passed a dude checking his mail and immediately thought of my friend's fiance, tim. i was not sure if it was his look, his clothing, the way he walked, the aura. i have no idea but i drove on about 30 seconds to the actual spot. the exact spot was a house, and the front door had this ontop of it: [the house of timothy?](https://i.redd.it/shbeo2s0aqc31.jpg) *power: 1.92.* now this spot was considered ""weak"" but here's the thing. i had parked near the house above and told my randonauting friend about the coincidence. we talked for a little and the topic became about the passing of her father, his spirit, reincarnation, etc. i reset my location, asked for an attractor, and got a cemetery. my friend could not believe it. synchronicity #2, my friends. i went and it was rather uneventful. i had to park outside near an amazing viewpoint i did not know existed, and had to walk through a little garden spot to get in because everything was locked. but somehow, as i was relaxing at the exact spot the gps told me to be at in the cemetery, a random car drove up and parked to also visit. they were inside the cemetery, but all the gates i had seen were locked.... and that's all folks!"
omfg i had one of my craziest experience of my life by this!!! tbh i was a but sceptic but now i've got a new hobby lol !,2019-07-27,me and my girlfriend wanted to do this at night because it's cooler and more atmospheric. this was our first tour so we weren't expecting anything. we walked to our first location in an industrial area. there were a few trucks and a long road. our goal was in a bush behind a fence. so we sharpened our senses and looked for whatever. i found a big feather but nothing else. but the sky was really clear and the starts were shining very bright. that was really awesome some sort of magical. we had goosebumps and were feeling a bit strange. the noises were 10 times louder than normal. it was a bit trippy but we hadn't taken drugs or smth. we both noticed some strange lights in the sky. like a white fast dot in the sky. then we made a new point with telegr it was only 600 m. we walked to the second location but is was in a private area with a hedge in front. so we looked at this hedge for something strange. i found a bill but it wasn't worth it. so we made a new point. as we walked 30 meters i guess my gf said look there! i looked around and exactly at this hedge we were standing was now a car with high beam on that shined in our eyes. i was wondering why at this time at this location and after we were looking there. it was so crazy i mean the car was standing right on the sidewalk facing to us with high beam on. i was joking this are the men in black and then the car made loud motor noises like it would run over us every second. we were really scared af and walked to the side where it could not hit us. then it dissaperaled backwards next to the hedge. we thought wwwtttfff. the goosebumps got so hard so we decided to walk away fastly. we were so shocked ! before our trip i was telling my gf that it could be dangerous because some dark power could lead us to nowhere where it could do harm to us. but i didn't mean it so seriously.. then i wanted a last point for this night. the last location was in a park right next to our home so we did. we sat on a bench smoked one and looked up into the sky. now comes the craziest part!! we both saw a fucking triangle - u f o !!! i couldn't believe it it was so low and we could see it exactly with it's lights and his triangular form! i've never seen something like this before ! we heard the low deep sound like a alpha wave from a binaural beat. it had blue yellow and red dots hovering directly over us. i took my phone and recorded it but the quality is shitty af because it was so dark and it almost dissapered behind the trees. but after i watched my video i was able to make a screenshot of it. it's not so good at all but you can see. i can out the clip online too of you want but it is really bad quality unfortunately. :( but the experience we had was soooo damn nice to me . one year ago i was seeing a white dot ufo extremely fast with wavy route (couldn't been a satellite or plane) but i've never seen one triangular like in much yt videos! me and my gf are still shocked now . i will upload the screenshot in the comments. thanks for reading !

observations from 4 chained attractors (significant high strangeness),2019-07-27,"# tl;dr: chained 4 attractors together, felt out of place, resulted in high strangeness first observation is that this project is art. performance art, experiential art, self improvement art, whatever you want to call it, my experience with the attractors was artistic and i'll tell you why. we course through our lives following the path of least resistance, which it turns out is put there by people in power or those who want to profit from us. for various reasons and methods, we're set on a track that is relatively predetermined, especially in groups. individuals are chaotic, groups are extremely predictable, but also individuals over a long enough period of time fall into patterns and are predictable as well. it is only those who resist the status quo and exist on the fringes that are unpredictable, and that is generally what people in power fear, since they can't control that which they cannot predict. think about it, every algorithm and neural net operating in the zeitgeist right now is yearning to predict our next behavior to sell us more shit. so, in this way, using a telegram bot to ping an api from a quantum vacuum chamber and transpose that truly random information onto a map to derive a location to travel to is artistic and resistant to the typical power structures and grooves on the record that we are set to play in everyday life. from the moment i left my residence for the first attractor, i knew i was 'out of place'. i shouldn't be in the places i was going, i had no explainable 'purpose' to be where i was going, and the paranoia and 'dispair meme' set in. i was primed for this in the overview, so i pressed on. my first attractor was a 5 dot something, which was somewhat exciting as i knew it was relatively more random than a lower number (even though i don't understand the math fully). as i pulled closer to the the designated point, i had what i could only describe as spidey senses, that i was entering a bubble of randomness and that i needed to pay closer attention. it was a cul-de-sac. i looped around and moved on. i saw a child's ball in the gutter near the spot. i decided not to pull over and get it. the despair meme won that round. i drove to a neutral location (not just randomly in front of someone's home) and set the next attractor, determined to chain them together for max weirdness. it was a lower number (2.3), and i pressed on. as i was driving, i focused on my thoughts. i still felt very 'out of place' but was getting more comfortable with it. i came up with stories to tell the cops if i got pulled over. i couldn't tell them i was on an artistic experiment using quantum random number generators. the pigs wouldn't understand and they'd lock me up. i would tell them i was playing pokemon go. a benign enough cover story for them to brush me off as a nerd and move on to put the boot on someone else's throat. with my cover story secure, i pressed on. another cul-de-sac near a park. i had music on in the car, and i tuned in to the music more as i drove. the 2nd attractor was next to a home and recovery center for paraplegics. i'd driven passed it many hundreds of times, but this time was a bit different. i saw it, which was interesting. wu tang clan bumped in the background and i moved to another neutral location to fire another attractor. here i want to say that while i don't discount the observations from other randonauts that they experience 'barriers' chaining multiple attractors together, i'd like to point out that it may just be statistics causing these barriers. i drove for an hour and a half tonight through small suburban back streets, much more than usual. the chance for a flat tire or fender bender or something weird increases with time on the road. i feel like the random bad things that happen when chaining together attractors may be the statistical result of being on the road more than any kind of other explanation, but i digress. **(edit: i wrote this before my later experiences, and i no longer think this but i wanted to leave it in here for posterity)** i rolled a 3rd attractor and was immediately shocked. i saw on the map my childhood neighborhood on the map (but it was over 1,000 miles away). i triple checked and it turns out that the town next to mine has a neighborhood with the same name as my childhood home. that was fun. i drove there, while nas rapped to me about what he would do if he ruled the world. i rolled my 4th and final attractor, thinking about calling it a night. it was on the way home, so i took that as a sign that 4 was enough. i arrived home and set to write about my experiences. *fast forward 30-45 minutes...* well, literally as i was writing this, my girlfriend called and we had to take her cat to the emergency vet. a couple of things: \- had i not gone on this journey tonight, i probably would have had 2-3 glasses of wine as is my usual friday night. i wouldn't have been able to drive her to the vet and felt terrible about it \- going on this journey tonight already significantly impacted the path i was on, very interesting results. **summary:** the cat will be ok, needs a few days in the hospital for a bladder blockage (ouch). i have a lot of thoughts about this entire experiment, and i hope to be an active member of the community going forward. thanks to the creator(s) of this, it's a really interesting experiment and i appreciate you creating it."
first time randonauting. the universe gave me some piece of advice.,2019-07-27,none
my first try today at randonauts at 5 different locations and i am not disappointed.,2019-07-27,"so i came across randonauts today not having a clue what it was but after doing a bit of research i just had to give it ago. i love the mandela effect and really wanted to see if i could make links by using randonauts. so i didn't look like a complete wierdo i decided to take my 2 dogs with me. before i left i download the app and bot and got it to choose me 5 random locations. i then planned my walk to each location. 1st location: whilst walking down the road to drop point on my map i could see a person walking in the distance and i could see that we were going to meet at the exact drop point. as we approached the point we walked pass each other and a cyclest came zooming past us on the pavement. one of my dogs instantly decided to go for a poo lol and as i looked at the house i was out side the couple who bought my previous property walked out the house. 2nd location i was come up to the location and couldn't see anything obvious approaching but then a car driving down the road stopped, stuck its indicator on and drove into the drive where the drop point was. as i walked by outside the house a car drove past and the woman driver looked at me. she looked identical to my mum and she had the same make car but wrong year on the number plate. 3rd location. this location took me to outside a pub. out side the pub was man and a woman sitting pub bench the man had a broken leg in a pink cast and the woman was in a wheelchair. they both asked to stroke me dogs and off i went. 4th location i was walking down the street to the drop point and in the distance i could see a woman walking 2 dogs and we meet at the drop point. at the drop point a man was also getting out his car after parking up. 5th location. i was walking to the drop point and could see a woman in her garden gardening. as i walked pass i heard a man say ""what do you want"" as i looked over i saw him talking to a boy in his front room as the windows were open. then i noticed by the front door they were selling some fishing nets (i'm big into my fishing) which was wierd. on the whole the whole thing was rather strange, something happened at every location to the exact point as i was walking pass. i would notice most of these things on my walks but what made it different was where it was happening. i can't wait to try it again but maybe do a car journey next time or try it in some country side."
coping with gps precision,2019-07-27,"hi. newcomer here. i was wondering... what about gps precision? i mean, if you're in an open space it's ok, you may follow your instinct as well. but let's say that there is a 10 meters error. if you're in a city, in a place with very narrow streets, 10 meters may mean inside a building, or the wall on your left or the wall on your right, for example..."

despair meme or just a coincidence,2019-07-28,"i was on the way to a point(4.72 power) at around 23:00 with my buddy, while we were driving to the point we saw a cop car just standing still on the road deciding which way to go. my buddy who was driving the car somehow got a bit stressed out by seeing the cop car and so he started questioning if we are allowed to continue driving on this road we were on. he's driven on this road at least a hundred times so he knows he could drive there. anyway he started driving the road the cop car was standing on since he wasn't sure anymore. the cop car slowly turned around and started tailgating us for a couple kilometers. they didn't want us to stop or anything either, they just followed us. it had this really eery feeling to it, i can't say i wasn't feeling a bit scared either. my buddy said he didn't do anything wrong and eventually told me that this started to feel like the beginning of a really bad movie to him. after a while the cop car went another direction. my buddy said he would've definitely driven the correct road if the cop car wasn't there and also found it strange that he questioned himself over why he couldn't drive that road. i remembered the despair meme and thought this was it, i mean in the end its just a bunch of policemen doing their work. we've also never felt fear from cops and there's actually no reason to be scared of them really. but somehow this instance felt really off, as if we shouldn't get to that point somehow. i feel kinda bad that i pulled my friend into this. in the end he said that he was actually quite scared during the encounter himself so i told him i'd go to the point another time and not to worry about it any further. now here's the thing, i just know for sure that if there was no intention of going to this point this wouldn't have happened as nothing ever happens. but suddenly we try to go to a point there's a cop car that induces some slight disruption in my friend that knows every road like the back of his hand."

first time with fatum: 2nd attractor took me to a doorbell with my literal name on it.,2019-07-30,https://i.redd.it/3e9cg28jnfd31.jpg i have a free day today so i decided to give the fatum bot a try. i went by bike because it's hot a s shit in europe right now and i didn't feel like walking. i set my radius to 1000 meters for my first attractor (power: 2.31) and it took me to an inner courtyard of an apartment building just outside my neighbourhood. it was gated so i couldn't go in so i decided to up my radius to 2000 meters and get a second attractor. the second had a power of 3.66 and took me to a street in my neighbourhood where a friend of me used to live and well... i found the doorbell with my name on it at the exact spot. my second name is kim and basically everyone calls me that way. i was feeling pretty euphoric and decided to go for a third attractor with a radius of 3000 meters. it took quite a while and while i was waiting for the coordinates a middled aged woman came up to the door and rang the fucking bell. she was walking quite fast and looked at me like she'd seen a ghost. i moved aside so she could get to the door but it took quite a while for someone to answer and she seemed in a rush so she knocked on the closed shutters of the first floor window. my third attractor then came up so i left but decided not to go there because it was in the river that flows through my city and i was also pretrty spooked out by that woman all of a sudden.

new stuff about the bot,2019-08-02,"suggested experiments basic suggestions 1. notice memetic impacts. if during a trip you experience a lot of excitement, energy and emotional lift, increased motivation and dopamine hit, note this fact in your report. this is important when assessing the impact of a void-meme. also note if in the process you are confronted with unreasonable fear and trespassing sensations or expressions of paranoid emotions, which may be a particular case of despair-meme. 2. specify in the report the code and power of the generated points, this will help to identify them in the system database and compare the observations with the statistical data of the calculations. 3. interact with the environment. the meaning of all the experiments in going beyond the ordinary patterns, so the more you affect the objects and events at a point, the stronger the butterfly effect will change the tunnel of reality. 4. note the long-term changes associated with visiting the fatum-points. even if nothing remarkable was found at the point itself, visiting it can trigger a domino-effect that will create anomalies in the future. 5. do not limit yourself to the point location. in fact, all your way to the point is a deviation from the pattern, so strange things may be waiting for you somewhere along the way. do not try to get to the point if it is dangerous, just get as close as you can without risk to health and without violating the laws. 6. collect artifacts. at the fatum-points strange objects may occur. it is recommended to collect them for further study. items also increase the deviation from the pattern, since their very presence around you is the result of the impact of fatum. such items may have an unusual destiny. 7. intention. at points of ida-type, influence of the thoughts on point location is theoretically possible. try to think about something good and refrain from experimenting if you constantly think about something bad. concentrate on the things you plan to find and the sensations that this will cause. 8. note synchronicities. the presence of significant inscriptions, signs and matches is important for the interpretation of experimental data. 9. report, if you discover in a well-known area, new territories that you did not know about before. blind-spots searching protocol the purpose of the experiment is to search for blind spots, ie places where a person cannot get by natural coincidence, because there is simply no reason for him to go there. for the experiment, it is recommended to use a small (1-3 km) radius and well-known terrain. for example, not far from home. to find blind spots, generate getquantum type points in this area. required to visit as many of these points as possible. as the points are randomly generated, and not dependent from the behavioural patterns your chance of hitting the blind spot increases. try to visit the points regardless of whether they are conveniently located and do you want to go there or not. if you skip the points and generate new ones until you find the most convenient one, this will lower your chances of success, since the randomness of the points will decrease. a blind spot is a place that you did not know existed before and have never been there. note whether this place is a blind spot only for you, or it is also rarely visited by other people too. you should not expect that the very first point will lead you to a blind spot; separation from causal patterns increases your chance of getting there, but does not make it 100%. however, the more points you visit, the higher the probability of finding a blind spot becomes. also note the unusual effects of travel or changes in attitude. intention driven anomalies ida is based on the ability of thoughts to influence the quantum probability found by pear princeton laboratory. points of this type are generated under the influence of your mood and intentions. these include points like attractors and voids. unlike the experiment with the search for blind spots, for these points it is not necessary to visit each one that the bot will offer you. visiting points with greater power makes the greatest sense, since the effect of intention on them is maximum. it is also recommended to set a larger search radius (3-10km), since the probability of finding the object of your intention increases on larger territory. when visiting these points, try to focus intention on specific things, thoughts or moods and compare them with what you will find in the resulting location or on the way to it. there are also blind spots at ida points, but their presence is not necessary, the places can be completely ordinary, their connection with your thoughts is most important. 1. intention validation the goal of this experiment is to find out how much your intention and your thoughts influence the ida points. notice images, objects or events related to what you thought before generating points. it is important to pay attention to the extent to which the appearance of such coincidences depends on the power level of the attractor/void. it is recommended to set a clear intention and to visit points with the greatest power, or sets of points of different power for comparison. if the artifacts found coincide with the thoughts or subjects of conversations of people you know or other participants before the experiments, it is also worth noting. 2. ida-chains the goal of the experiment is to find out whether the effect of ida points accumulates if you build them into successive chains. to do this, generate an attractor/void, reach its location and set it as the current location in the bot, and then from there generate the next attractor/void. in the process, you should note the change in the level of synchronicities and the occurrence of events that resist building a chain. it is necessary to indicate in the report the number of links and to be attentive to the long-term consequences. 2. pair comparison the purpose of the experiment is to establish the difference between the attractor and the void ida types. to do this, use the getpair command or find attractors and voids from one getida[] set. this is important, since both points must meet the same intention. you should visit both points and compare with each other. 3. sets comparison the purpose of the experiment is to establish if something in common with ida's formed by same intention. here you need to use points from one set that can be obtained with commands like getattractor[5] (returns a set of 5 attractors), getvoid[5] or getida[10] (returns 10 points of both types). you can focus on one type of points in a set or both, but it is important to visit several points of each selected type. you need to compare, for example, attractors with each other and find that they all have in common. when you find the overall quality, match it with your intention or thoughts at the time of generation. 4. blind experiment the purpose of the experiment is to separate the real properties of fatum-points from the expectations of the researcher. will the same effects persist if you dont know what type of point you visited? to do this, use the getpoint command. it will return a point of unknown type without a description. after visiting this point, add its code to the report, this will allow us to determine which type of point you visited."

crazy first experience! what does it all mean!?,2019-08-03,"so today i got bored at work. i was scrolling through twitter and saw something about ""randonauts"". as i began reading it became more and more intriguing. i decided that after work i would give it a go. as the day went on i was scrolling through reddit reading about different conspiracy theories. i came across a thread about the saturn time cube. after reading that my mind was blown. i went on with my day at work. towards the end of my work day i decided to hop on coinbase. i am always looking at the top ""up and coming"" cryptocurrencies. as i was scrolling through the top 50, i came across one that caught my eye. the crypto is called ""stellar lumens"". as i was looking at it's logo i couldn't help but notice it looked like saturn ([picture of logo](https://gyazo.com/cd082f70a68802dc21995af33abf9dcb)). i thought it was just a coincidence so i shrugged it off and finished my work day. i went home, had dinner and decided to hit up fatum-bot and get my first location. i got the location and headed on my way. it brought me to a trail. as i parked my car at the beginning of the trail i couldn't believe my eyes. the logo for the trail is the exact same as the stellar lumens logo. which as i stated before, looks like saturn, which i was researching earlier in the day. at this point my mind is blown and i am freaking out. i don't know what it means. should i invest in this cryptocurrency!? should i fly to saturn!? i'm just at a loss and completely mind fucked. would love to hear what you think. thank you. https://i.redd.it/auuk2zay75e31.png"

"ide: riverdale, money and love - it worked",2019-08-03,"i guess confirmation bias is a powerful thing because my first exploration with the fatum bot was a striking success. i don't really believe in the esoteric explanation of it all but it still blew my mind a bit. so i tried the /ide with a radius of 1000 meters. i didn't know what to think about so i chose the tv show riverdale because i've been watching it lately. the point led me...well... to a river opposite mansion that, with some goodwill, looks like thistlehouse (one central set in the series). *processing img os25wh5om8e31...* *processing img jsguh45om8e31...* this ist [thistlehouse](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/riverdalearchie/images/8/89/rd-caps-2x15-there-will-be-blood-15-thistlehouse.png/revision/latest?cb=20180315150907) on riverdale. &amp;#x200b; second point i thought about money, finding money. i expected to find a penny in the grass or something which i didn't. but the point led me to a bank. not an atm where i could actually get money but an office building of a bank. good enough. &amp;#x200b; *processing img slvromp7n8e31...* last on e blew my mind the most. i thought about love. point led me to a street called marseilles which i guess one could associate with france which is often associated with love. it's a stretch but anyway. when i got there it was a botanical garden. point was at an ordinary stone off the path. i sat down on a bench, a little disappointed. but after a while i decided to actially look at the stone. and lo and behold, there was a patch of moss vaguely resembling a heard shape. then i saw something glistening in the grass and found a heart &amp;#x200b; https://i.redd.it/h1qhs875o8e31.jpg https://i.redd.it/52q17rb5o8e31.jpg"

randonaut attractor comparison challenge,2019-08-04,"so now that the bot has an updated more precise algorithm and some new features, there are some experiments we can run to start understanding how intention and attractors work. sets comparison challenge the purpose of the experiment is to establish if something in common with anomalies formed by same intention, within the same generation. here you need to use points from one set that can be obtained with commands like getattractor[5] (returns a set of 5 attractors), getvoid[5] or getida[10] (returns 10 points of both types). you can focus on one type of points in a set or both, but it is important to visit several points of each selected type. you need to compare, for example, attractors with each other and find that they all have in common. when you find the overall quality, match it with your intention or thoughts at the time of generation. so basically, set your intention, use /getattractor[5] and visit all 5 attractors (or whatever kind of anomaly, and note if they have anything in common."

"went in with the general intention of experiencing love, here's what happened",2019-08-06,"so on today's expedition into wonderland i generated an attractor with a radius of 5 km and my intention when generating it was to experience love in any general sense. my thought process with this intention was to maybe see some interesting art representing love, or maybe encounter a a couple or a family sharing a loving moment. what actually happened was pretty cool. the location led me to a dead end road at the very back of a mountain side neighborhood with a hardly visible path leading up the side of the mountain. the despair meme kicked in pretty hard as i was a little sketched out about following the path thinking it might be private property. i followed it anyways with the thought of love in the back of my mind, knowing that nothing bad would happen. i followed the trail up a little bit and as it went on it started to fade out and disappear. at the end of the trail off to the side i saw a big chunk of abandoned rusted metal laying in the dirt/grass. it looked like some abandoned car part. something weird looking orange ball caught my eye sitting underneath the metal. again, the despair meme kicked in at this point thinking that when i reached underneath the metal to grab this thing a snake or something might attack me. i ignored the thought and grabbed it. it was a dog collar with a little orange led light and button chained with two metal tags tucked inside of a small camo pouch. [picture](https://imgur.com/a/ugl1gqy) one tag was a shiny metal one shaped as a heart (wow!), the other was was a rectangular camo tag. the heart tag had ""if found, please call..."" and then a phone number on it. again, despair meme, but i called. it went to a local pet registration office where i talked to a guy and told him i found what looked like a dogs tag. he told me to call the number on the other tag to talk to the owner. there were two numbers on the camo tag, so i called the first but the number was non-existent. i then called the second one and a guy answered. he was located in a neighborhood nearby and we coordinated a spot to meetup so i could return the tag to him. when i got to the spot, we talked for a little bit and i got to meet the dog the collar belonged to along with his other dog! he was super cute and i was relieved to know he wasn't lost. the guy was really nice and super appreciative. we shook hands and then i went on my way. it was a really cool experience and i'm really happy with the results of that intention. each time i go on another randonaut adventure i get better about identifying the despair meme when it hits and combating it. interesting things always tend to happen when you break though the despair meme and interact with your findings at locations!"

i dont know what the universe is trying to tell me,2019-08-06,"so my bf and i decided to try this out yesterday. we set off to an attractor at a park just down the street from our house. when we got to the area we found two cigar packets. nothing unusual. we kept walking. about 5 feet up from that spot, we came across this empty weed pouch. people really like to litter at parks, huh? we set off to another attractor. in the exact spot where the pin is, is an empty cigarette pack. this is probably just a coincidence, right? we walk back to the park and sit down to try and figure out if we want to go home or try another attractor. i sit on the ground and look to my left, there is a single cigarette butt. the only cigarette butt in my entire line of vision. i'm getting kind of spooked at this point. the attractor sends us to a street that would take about 15 minutes to walk, so we decide to drive there. my bf says its some dead end street behind some houses. its about 10pm at this point so the street looks kind of creepy. we get to the beginning of the street, and i get a weird feeling. we drive down to the very end of the street and we see a car parked in the bushes. as we're turning around we notice theres a couple in the car, smoking weed together. i'm freaking out at my boyfriend at this point, trying not to get hysterical lmao. so we decide we're done for now and start driving to a convenience store. as we're driving i'm trying to get my bf to understand how weirded out i am. he bursts into laughter and asks me ""what was the lady buying in front of us when we went to the convience store earlier?"" this goddamn lady was trying to find smokes cheaper than $10. what so i do with this info recap: two cigar packets an empty pouch that had weed in it an empty cigarette pack a single cigarette butt this one freaked me out the most. a single car on a dead end road nobody ever goes, where a couple is smoking weed. lady at convenience store was heckling cashier over cheap smokes.

quick warning,2019-08-10,"i'm typing this out mostly for the women on this community but also because it's ridiculous that even on so called subculture groups such as this, women cannot escape the limiting and demeaning paradigms that have been dictated for a long time in mainstream culture. the owner of several randonauts chats, comrade, likes to pretend he's some bohemian liberal with ""zero tolerance for sexism and racism"" when in reality he's about as big an entitled douchebag as your average man-child bro. i have only been using the rando-bot for a month and comrade has already made sure i have the most uncomfortable experience that's in his power to make for me on telegram &amp; his group chat just because i declined his advances after realizing he and another member of the chat were in the same city as myself and meeting up with them one afternoon. a couple of days after the brief meeting at a park, comrade sent me messages at 4am, claiming to be drunk and using that as a segue to tell me he had ""the biggest crush on me and was handling it terribly"", to which i politely replied that i was not interested, that he didn't even know me enough to have any real basis for any genuine feelings towards me, and that he was probably confusing his emotions as we are often wired to think of people of the opposite sex as nothing but potential romantic partners. to not worry about it as i had already forgotten of his confession and we could just continue to be friends- something, at the time, i meant sincerely. he claimed to agree but after that exchange, his behavior just got more manic. sending me ""you're so hot"" type messages privately when i was trying to talk to him about putting together audio and image files as a resource for people on here experiencing anxiety &amp; other initiatives to improve the online community. he also started using his randonauts group chat to try and make it seem like we had something going on in front of members of the chat by saying he was making a mixtape for me after he posted about how romantic it was when ""lovers"" made mixtapes for each other, continuing to try to force me into whatever scenario and role he had decided in his mind, regardless of how many times i had declined it. i did my best to deflect his comments for the sake of everyone on the group chat, but he just continued until the ""flirting"" turned to hostility and he called me an asshole under the claim that i was making him look bad in front of people on the chat when he is the one who has worked hard to make this a spectacle in the first place. i left his group chats, blocked him and dismissed his behavior for the ridiculousness that it is, but seems he's just thirsting for attention, no matter how negative, so not even a week after the fact, he joined another chat he knew that i was on, just to start spouting out insults to everyone on the chat, but of course using sexist slurs toward women when doing so, since i guess he doesn't have the balls to address me directly. all the while, his internet pals make excuses for his nonsense with pseudo-philosophical bullshit as if the dude is not pushing 30 and it being time he realizes his adolescent tantrums just come off as creepy and pathetic. and as if he was not ready to talk all sorts of shit about the guys on the group chat when he thought i might be romantically interested in, telling me ""if i only knew how they are in real life"" i'd be ""shocked"". seems rather ridiculous to want to talk to aliens without knowing how to talk to other human beings like human beings first. and to want to grasp metaphysical concepts without being able to grasp everyday basic healthy social dynamics. i will be leaving the telegram platform altogether as soon as this is posted since, as the record has shown, there's probably only more hostility to come from him- which i guess is the price to pay for women that decline to fuck those who have deluded themselves into thinking they're ""nice guys""? i wonder if anyone on here thinks this is acceptable behavior were it directed towards their girlfriend, their sister, or their mom... are women just worthy of consideration and respect from men when there's a adjective that implies possession? would i be better off saying i have a boyfriend as to not directly hurt his ego and maybe that way hed be scared to get beat up? can women be respected as individuals for the decisions they make as such? just wanted to give that word of advice to everyone on here and to thank comrade for making me feel uncomfortable and unsafe on the internet in record time. 2 weeks. impressive. keep it up and maybe you can get back to your online boys only club soon, the only place where you seem to have any power and can filter your psychotic personality enough for people to stick around."

voodoo weirdness on the walk back home,2019-08-12,"i decided to do a randonaut walk in my neighborhood yesterday morning. the new bot wasn't responding, so i did an attractor chain using fatum-bot. my intention was simply, ""positive energy."" there was nothing too mind-blowing at the four points i visited. a squirrel was sitting right on the first point, and she didn't immediately run away when i approached. (i had a dream about a squirrel two nights before this.) the second point was just a very ordinary house that didn't stand out in any way. the third point was a security camera on a pole at a construction site. and the fourth point had a burned out mattress and a filthy couch sitting by a stinky dumpster at an apartment complex. i decided to call it a day and take the shortest route back to my house. i turned the corner and encountered a man just standing in the middle of the road, looking totally dazed and out of it. strange! about halfway down the same block, there was a bus stop with a man and a woman sitting there. as i got closer, i realized that the man was holding a big tangled mess of long, brown human hair. he then said to the woman, ""now all i gotta do is get me some chicken bones."" next they looked up, smiled, and said hello. i returned their kind greeting and kept on walking at a good pace. that street definitely seemed to have a pocket of weirdness going on. i finally made it to my street, a few blocks from home, and i saw my boyfriend riding his bike right past me! perhaps that was the positive energy/synchronicity i was looking for."

randonaut trip report - 08/11/2019,2019-08-12,"staging: i decided early sunday morning that a randonaut trip for the family would be a good way to spend the day, to which they all happily agreed! i set out with my two daughters (13 and 11) and my girlfriend of many many years now. we initially set out without intentions (hoping to see what happens) and later attempted setting intentions. we left by truck and didn't walk very much of the trip. there was no hesitation or resistance (despair meme) effects throughout the trip. &amp;#x200b; point 1: we generated our first attractor from home and found one with a power of .67 roughly a mile from our home. upon arriving my eldest daughter noted that the school was where she had taken gifted classes before. the exact point led us to a wall with the word communicators in big bold text, which we all thought was particularly interesting right off the bat. the wall had other words as well like knowledge. &amp;#x200b; point 2: from the school we then generated another point, setting happiness as our intention. this is a pretty vague intent, so we were curious to see what turned up. the second point led us directly to a garage sale, something that my girlfriend and kids enjoys a lot! we didn't notice anything too uncanny here, but one of the things for sale that seemed interesting and somewhat out of place from the other items was an asian style tortoise with a world like shell on it. &amp;#x200b; point 3: our last attactor point was generated from the garage sale and led us directly to an rv that was for sale. we've been seriously considering buying some land up north for about a year now, and that process would involve buying an rv to stay in while we're building a house. this caught my attention. the trip to the rv was more interesting though as it led us down a street with somem oddities hanging about. each of the older houses on this street had a centerpiece to their lawn, from big granite stones with plaques on them, to an old electrical pole with antique equipment attached to it. one yard had a lion, another had a dragon, they all had something a little weird going on in them. &amp;#x200b; all in all an interesting trip and we plan on doing this regularly now! i've included links to images of some of these finds below: &amp;#x200b; [https://ibb.co/lp4x9tl](https://ibb.co/lp4x9tl) [https://ibb.co/jhmmqwf](https://ibb.co/jhmmqwf) [https://ibb.co/fxjfwpc](https://ibb.co/fxjfwpc) [https://ibb.co/sbk2txs](https://ibb.co/sbk2txs)"

first attempt with the bot today and traveled to a nearby void,2019-08-13,"the trip was a little interesting, but more in a personal way due to the feeling that the area imparted in me. i woke up this morning a bit sick and initially called out of work. i think i'm dealing with a stomach ulcer but that's all aside the point. after going back to bed for a bit, i woke up and got on facebook where i read screenshots of [someone's twitter thread about theories around 2012 and the end of the world](https://twitter.com/nickhintonn/status/1154523206692331520). by looking up the op on twitter, i found this subreddit. the location that the bot sent me to was down a long and winding single lane road, surrounded by valleys, lakes, and faux farmland. the area is a small gated community wherein the average house costs around $680,000 (according to my googling), and the gates were wide open when i approached. weirdly, there are only about five or six houses in total throughout the road, so it's hard to call it a neighborhood. i've never seen it before despite having lived a few minutes down the county road it's on for almost twenty years, likely because of how tucked away it is; i had to double around because i passed the entrance my first attempt. as i drove down the road i got a strange feeling that caused my blood pressure to rise and made me rethink my being there. i was unsure of whether any of the inhabitants (if there even are any) would approve of my presence, noting how secluded and private this area is, and considering the arguably, potentially dark nature of the intention i set out with before requesting the void location. this came to a peak when i was about a couple hundred feet from my destination. the road was turning thinner and less paved; more foliage was surrounding me, so i was worried about how easily i could get away if i needed to, and at that point thought i should turn around as soon as i got the chance at the end of the road. it was then that, in the spot where i was going to turn around, i noticed a sign in a tree that read ""park here."" so i did. with my keys still in my hand i got out of the car and approached the point where the bot was taking me. nothing in this general area was particularly notable: a set of three swings, a pool house i gleamed into, a lake with a ladder descending into it, and a sectioned off, man made beach. the grass was well kept and the area wasn't dilapidated, so i assume people use this place, especially since i saw, through one of the windows, two small sea buggy type vehicles. but there was a quietness in the air that i couldn't shake. i saw no other vehicles in the driveways of the homes i passed, and felt a specific lack of human presence as i stood there looking out over the lake. once i heard the sound of a passing truck echo across the lake, from the county road, but otherwise there was only the sound of cicadas and waves lapping against the rope that sectioned off the beach's swimming area. it felt strangely like a place i know from either a dream or a distant memory. i think that would be a great way to describe the aura of this location. you know how in a dream, even when interacting with other characters, you don't feel the presence of ""another"" in the same way that you do in a waking state? that's what i felt here. it felt like being alone at the house after your family's gone on vacation. it just felt like being alone. at one point, down the road from where i was, i approached a building but couldn't tell whether it was a house or an extension of the community/pool house area. it had some characteristics of a residential building: a trashcan by the backdoor, some potted plants, a driveway, but i got the distinct feeling that no one was here, despite how it appeared inhabited by how well kept it is. maybe everyone in the neighborhood was just collectively ""somewhere else"" this morning. other than the sign, nothing really stood out to me, but also i was kind of in a hurry as i decided to head into work since i was feeling better, and also anxious about potentially being accosted by a bourgeois baby boomer or some other such type. interestingly, there was a small, mobile room - imagine a small tool shed on wheels - that was painted entirely black, sitting in the woods about fifty feet from where i parked. it had a single rectangular window and a thin door, and its appearance reminded me of a [time cube conspiracy i'd read earlier](https://twitter.com/nickhintonn/status/1151986453569605632) from the same author as the 2012 tweets. i started to approach it, but got uneasy about it, and about the loud crunch of my footsteps on the leaves, so i decided against it."

am i crazy or now aware of the simulation?,2019-08-14,"hello randonauts, i recently stumbled upon the saturn time cube thread via twitter and have become quite infatuated with everything about it. however i cant help but feel almost connected to this information. my entire life i have always felt different and this has always been confirmed in some way or another but for some reason while reading the thread i found a lot of weird coincidences that i just cant ignore. in the thread he talked about the significance of numbers such as 3,6,9 and i also came across the number 27 somewhere in there. my favorite number since i was a child has always been 6 and i have always said how saturn is my favorite planet (lol as kids i feel like you almost have to pick a favorite everything). just the other day i also found out that i am a type 9 personality which has to do with chakras and energies (which is also relevant to the time cube conspiracy). i am also born on october 27th, of the year 2000 which, again, kind of spooky. another small detail to add is that i am a very level headed person, and i came to realize that throughout my life due to the hot-headed people in my upbringing. in the thread he explains that you should always remain neutral because we are basically powering the cube through our energies, or something along those lines. and while coming to realize all of this last night i threw on a youtube video and shortly i noticed that the youtube video was 13:33 minutes long. there are so many other instances through my life that i feel are significant in this situation but wont get into. im not sure if i am just putting these details together because the shoe fits or if it actually has any real meaning to me?? sos!"

question: how long are the points good for?,2019-08-15,"i haven't been able to go and do a randonaut trip, and i was curious to see how long the randomly generated points are good for."
intention anomaly found,2019-08-16,"ok... i had a friend txt me the info. on the fantom project, which i found very coincidental given the fact that i just finished watching the oa last week. never mentioned to her that i was watching the show. i decided to join your community and give the 1st random location a try and now i have to share my experience with y'all (very weird shit happened). it was about 11pm (not too long ago) when i got in my truck with my dog and was following the route fantom bot calculated for me. it took me to my brother's apartments. i could not get in because the apartments are gated, i do not have the code, and i didn't want to wake my brother up and ask him for it. at that point, i'm sitting in my truck wondering why fantom bot led me to my brother. my dog started to cry and i drove back home feeling like this was a failed attempt. i got home and i took a closer look at the location sent to me. i zoomed in on the maps enough to see that it was actually a house and not the apartments where my brother lives (strange). so of course my curious butt got back into the truck with my dog. i closed the fantom bot and decided to use google maps and manually type in the address given to me. i pulled out of my driveway and my freakin truck lights started to malfunction. they turned off!!! dashboard lights, radio, and headlights went completely out for about a min. truck was still on. i parked and called my friend. the moment she answered, everything turned back on. i was so scared, but i still drove to the house. i've never seen that house before. don't know who lives there. it was too late to knock on the door, so i left. and now i'm here sharing my ridiculously long experience. i'm intrigued. why did the 1st attempt lead to my brother? did the universe try to sidetrack me because i was going off path? why did the lights turn off in the truck? was that a sign? very weird, but i will continue with the next locations that fantom bot calculates for me."
my mom created two intention-related anomalies,2019-08-16,"we like plants a lot, and collecting or seeing an interesting plant is always a hot topic in our household. we're gardeners and have some fairly unusual plants in our yard. you won't find them in just any old yard. i'd wager the variety and depth of diversity in our garden is significant enough that you'd have to go to a garden center or botanical garden to match it. so we were at home in the afternoon, the other day, sunny, normal day. my mom set the radius to relatively nearby, like not quite the lowest setting, but walking distance. then before asking for an anomaly, my mom did an ""intention"" direction or ""meditation"" on ""finding a cool plant."" the bot returned two anomalies, and . . . both were in our yard. one pin was right next to our witch hazel patch, which if you know anything about witch-hazels, that is a bit eerie. well that's where all the cool plants are, i guess! but how did fatum know?! i thought it was supposed to be random. how in the fuck did it return our very own backyard? that really bent my brain pretty hard. how did it know there weren't any cool plants around other than our spot?"
an interesting adventure has me thinking there is something weird about this,2019-08-16,"i was directed here by a thread on twitter that made me curious but i remained skeptical. that is until today when i decided to take a much-needed break from writing my dissertation for school to go for a walk and get some fresh air. a good time to test this out and satisfy my curiosity. before taking off towards the attractor point, i had been reminiscing about a trip to scotland i had taken about two years ago. upon leaving my building, i immediately ran into a scottish man and his wife walking the same way i was. i didn't think too much about it until a group of scottish guys came up to me and asked for directions. i thought this was odd but still could just be a coincidence. as i was approaching my destination, a man at a bus stop collapsed right in front of me. i stayed to offer help to other bystanders while an ambulance was on the way. before the ambulance could get there, the man woke up like nothing was wrong and hopped on the next bus. i continued towards the attractor point just down the road. right on the spot where i was being directed to was a car that had been on fire very recently. at this point, i started thinking about how weird this all was. i decided to sit on a bench to think about things for a few minutes. as i was getting ready to stand up and leave, i looked to my left and noticed an empty bottle of irn bru (a popular scottish soft-drink). now i'm thinking about all the scottish people i had encountered again. i then decided that i would go to another attractor point on my way ""home."" i was led to a bench in the park that had the inscription ""for joan hoyt, a canadian who has so enjoyed this park"". this was weird for me because i am canadian and have only been living in london for the past year while i have been going to school. when i thought about home, the bot must have wanted to remind me of where i came from. am i reading too much into these or does all of this seem strange to you as well?"
exploring nature within a new city,2019-08-16,"i recently moved to boise for college. i always feel uncomfortable moving to a new place for the first few weeks due to unfamiliar environment. add that to my social anxiety of being around so many people i dont know in a city. i was feeling especially anxious this morning when i woke up. i wanted to get away from people and be by myself for awhile. i reminisced about the times as a kid, growing up on a farm, where i would just go adventure. id go out into the trees near river and explore. i decided my sense of adventure had been lacking lately so received an attractor as a way of exploring my new environment. (power: 3.66, z-score: 3.71) this was my first experience ever using this service. it took me to a river in the middle of town with a populated cement walking path far above the banks. the location was right on the bank of this river, so i climbed down through thick trees to the riverside where i was greeted by a bent tree overhanging the river. i made the treacherous walk on the tree trunk that hung 15 feet over shallow running water. totally unprepared for where the attractor would take me, i was in untied skate shoes and shallow pocketed shorts. i had to stuff my phone and my keys down in my underwear, because they would almost fall out of my pocket and into the water with each movement i made. it was a meditative and calming experience sitting on the top of the trunk over the water. not only was i able to find a new place but now i have a new spot to go experience with friends. the pictures dont die it much justice but [here they are](https://imgur.com/gallery/o0gpjxf)"

walk in the woods leading to a mural,2019-08-17,"intention: i was imagining a world with more kindness, more connection to nature, more beauty, more space. the journey: i was exploring a wooded college campus on foot. i walked some paved roads at first, then tried taking a dirt path. the path was beautiful but eerily quiet and i encountered only one person. i encountered several graffiti of mushrooms. (funny aside - later that night when cooking dinner, i realized i had a crimini mushroom that was in a perfect heart shape.) i passed by a snakeskin, like a garter snake's. the point: it was a very quiet college residential hall in the woods. there were deer watching me unafraid. the building was unusually designed. for instance, there was a wall with windows looking out into the woods, but with no attached buildings. the point itself was very near the wall with a window and a residential unit's deck that overlooked the woods. near the point, there was a mural that said ""possibilities"" and it showed a beautifully painted planetary scenescape with indigenous dwellings. it seemed aligned with my intention. at any rate, it was definitely a place that i had zero reason to go to otherwise and it was a pretty walk with cute deer.

the world's smartest navigation system,2019-08-17,"i came across the fatum-bot in the past few days and would like to share couple experiences i had in this timeframe. as soon as i got the bot i started to create attractors without much of an intention behind it and only visited couple points that, apart from the despair meme, showed nothing special. i then had to take my daughter from daycare and i normally drive there, so i decided to check what the bot had for me and created another attractor. luckily, this one was on a low-speed road i usually pass by on the way to daycare. again, no real intention behind this. i was approaching the spot shown on the map and, when i was right next to it, a truck was coming from the other end of the road and passed by. on the front of the truck there was a huge text that read focus (if you are familiar with bikes you will know the brand). given my lack of intention on the previous attempts, i understood the message. since then, i started to really focus on my intention and look for something that has been on my mind lately. sometimes you can think constantly about something without realising it and, after some thought, i realised i have been thinking a lot about my purpose in life. this morning my dog needed to go for a walk and i thought this could be a good opportunity to focus my intention on my purpose (in the general sense, in life, today, this week, whatever). i took my daughter with me as well and when we got outside i generated and ida, it was a void, power 3.03, z-score -3.96. i knew very well the spot on the map. its a kids playground i used to go few months back with my daughter but hadn't been there since. again, i got the message. perhaps my purpose was to play with my daughter and be with her. we walked there, spent some time on the playground and returned home. it was great. the most striking thing to me, though, was what we saw on our way there. picture here: https://imgur.com/a/pdrm0n0 experience the world's smartest navigation system, are you kidding me? and the name is theqexperience? i immediately thought of the quantum experience. i think that was my second purpose for the day and will certainly experience the worlds smartest navigation system again soon."

fatum-bot's last attractor point of the day took me home!,2019-08-17,"i've been doing randonaut journey's for about two weeks now, today was my third trip. i had my trip radius set to about 3.5 miles. what i've been doing is sending my location, going to the point (or as close as i can get, two out of three places on every trip have been inaccessible; deep in the woods off of a road that doesn't actually exist, beside the hanger of an airport, etc), setting my new location and generating another point, and then doing it a third time. i've been having a lot of fun and seeing places that, while in my neighborhood or on my normal driving routes, i've never noticed before. i have also been setting what i think is a random intention, and today was to see butterflies. i tried to get to my first point, but it was inaccessible by the first direction, and so i went in a big loop to try to get to it from a neighboring town, and after that didn't work either, i got as close as i could, and set a new point. the post office was only a few minutes out of the way in that second town, so i stopped in for stamps, and as i walked in a butterfly flew in from of me. i went to the second point, and didn't see anything special. i thought maybe i should just go home and work in the yard, but i had said i'd do three points, so i wanted to stick with that and i sent my location and generated my last point for the day. the attractor point i got back was the dirt alley outside my house! the exact point it was showing is where an old garage owned by a neighbor once stood, and now all that's left of it is a 3' high cinder block enclosure around a cement pad. i obeyed the bot and got back in my car and drove home, and as i pulled up my driveway it started pouring. the rain only lasted for about five minutes, and i'm going to go do that yard work now :)"

teaching by example,2019-08-18,"another day using the bot and another amazing experience. my dog and i left home in the morning and i set my intentions on having a positive impact on someone else's life during this walk. i summoned an anomaly and the bot gave me a very weak attractor but i decided to go there anyway, the point is close to the seashore, a nice spot for a morning walk. nothing out of ordinary there so i got a new ida. this time it was much stronger, an attractor with 4.35 power and it was 500m away from the point we were. we got to the road of the attractor through a perpendicular street and the attractor was on the same side of the road as we were but, as i approached the road, the sun light caught a pedestrian cross sign and it shone really bright on my eyes from where i was standing. it sounds like a freaking biblical passage, but that's what happened, i swear. i decided to cross to the other side even the though, as i mentioned, the attractor was on the same side we arrived. we walked couple more minutes and reached the biggest crossroads on this road, that was around 70m away from the attractor. i approached the traffic lights and at the same time a lady with a kid that was about 3 years old was pushing a stroller, they stopped next to me. i looked sideways and there were no cars at all coming from any direction. the lights were red for us and i decided to wait because, although i don't fluently speak the language of the country i live in, i understood that the lady was explaining to the young girl how the traffic lights work and why they were waiting. the lights turn green and we start to cross the street at the same time when, out of nowhere, she turns to me and sys ""thank you!"". i was so stunned by that small gesture because a warm human-to-human interaction in this country are an expensive commodity. all i could say to her was ""you have to teach by example"". she nodded and said a very friendly ""yeah"". i kept walking to the attractor point, which was on the other side of the road but i didn't bother going to the exact spot. i was happy to have had a positive impact on someone else's life, even if it was small, and perhaps the journey is more important than the destination. it was a happy sunday morning."
gnostic goddess struggles to escape rut and despair,2019-08-18,"this may be the first time in my life i am talking to the right people about my hyper strange, way too much like fiction life, that despite being at times incredible and often ridiculously entertaining, still feels like it's been stuck in limbo, waiting forever to begin. and despite having a somewhat charmed existence in many ways, at the center of my experience i've suffered a terrible loneliness, repeated heartaches, and involuntary solitude that makes absolutely no sense in light of my outgoing personality and adventurous life style. it makes no sense unless i'm being intentionally held back from achieving my true reality and joining my rightful companion by negative forces. it seems that something harmful has been operating behind the scenes; something way beyond the run of the mill programmed self doubt so rampant in these dark ages. yet despite feeling stuck, i've spent decades learning more and more about our situation, all the while understanding that our lives are basically dreams being generated by our sleeping souls that slumber in a root world in which there is no time, and no space. the only thing truly real being the miracle that we exist at all. behind the scenes we sleep, eternally dreaming our dreams, each one of us a part of the whole like individual cells that form a brain, or a cluster of grapes suspended over a vast nothingness. now, after years of the above, i recently realized that these dreams we share seem to perfectly fit the model of a computer simulation, or virtual reality ( yes, i'm a little slow; it's part of being ancient). and i only just realized that finally now there are many people who believe this as well, and some of them may have figured out how to break out of the prisons that our civilization teaches us to construct around ourselves from birth. so it was only weeks ago that i started to take a fresh look this, and less than a week ago that i learned about randonauts and the fatum project. and despite not having enough time at the moment to read more about it or to download the bot and get started, i was exited enough to share a link with 2 or 3 of my close friends, telling them in person what little i had already learned of all this during an all night visit, mentioning specifically that when one begins to try to break out of their tunnel, they may be hit with the despair meme. that was about 3 days ago then, returning home from visiting these friends in the morning, i was about 15 minutes from my house, ready to get some rest and then continue to research this long awaited break through for escaping soul bondage. i was in a great mood, listening to upbeat music when i accidentally drove a little too fast and got pulled over by a seasoned narcotics officer k-9 unit who shortly thereafter took me to jail in handcuffs for a tiny amount of a controlled substance that i had in my purse. because i now live in a small town, i waited 20 hours in a cold cement holding cell before even seeing a judge who told me i was charged with a state jail felony and then set a fairly expensive bail for my release, despite it being my first ever such charge and my being a property owner who lived just a short distance away. all this just hours after telling my friends about my intention for us all to explore these new locations and to break out of our ruts, and warning each of them of the possibility of being confronted with despair, a point of which i was well aware during the painfully slow and uncomfortable 30 hours i satin captivity with nothing to do except fight the misery that was closing in, refusing to fall into hopelessness or to back away from my plans out of fear. 32 hours and $1200 later i was home again and i think the worst is over. i believe they will drop the charges as the officer probably didn't have good cause to search me in the first place, and it was just a failed attempt to break my will, which i will not allow. that was just yesterday. today i joined reddit and this group and i plan to move forward with randonauting over the next few days. for now i wanted to share my experience in general, especially of being hit hard in the face by the despair meme before i could even start. here is why i suspect that i might be under extra heavy pressure to stay trapped; since young adulthood my life's dream has been to spark a mass enlightenment by returning to our family a body of knowledge that was suppressed over time by the various death cults that have been ruling most of the world for known history. and the reason that these dark ages is the only history that is very well known, is because over time our conquerors obliterated as much as possible of the more enlightened cultures that they enslaved or destroyed as they took over our world. i'm quite sure that i have a special insight into this topic, blended with some unique skills and charms that can deliver a fat healthy slice of the free-dope and dancing in the streets revolutionary gnosis that we all deserve after having suffered under the yoke of tyranny for what feels like ages. this will be an undesirable outcome for the psychopaths that rule this realm. oh well, it's our time to shine and leave their sorry butts behind. thank you for letting me tell my story; it's been a struggle that i've never been able to share with people who seemed qualified to understand, let alone offer advice... until now. i sincerely appreciate anyone who took the time to read this post."
quick q about backgrounds,2019-08-18,"i know this whole thing is about being as empirical and experimental as possible, but i have a question about backgrounds and beliefs. reading some of the randonauts literature i get a thelemic flavor, are there thelemites and chaos magicians here? i love the ""only fools enter here"" mindset and feel these types are the best types for this stuff. show me the dangerous portal i say! always willing to boldly go where others are terrified to tread."

an attractor i went to while visiting new hampshire a few weeks ago led me to a meditation garden with a notebook for all of those who discover it to write in.,2019-08-19,"i thought i would post this story because it was definitely one of my most interesting attractor finds. i went to n.h. to visit family, and i set aside one day for myself to explore the small town my family grew up in. after exploring the main part of the town, i decided to try generating an attractor. my intention behind this adventure was complete open mindedness for whatever it was i would find. i generated the attractor and walked to the area. it's located outside of the main town area in a more wooded part of town. i follow a street surrounded by forest that takes a loop back around to the main street. about halfway through the loop, i reach where the exact point is situated. i walk around the area a little bit noticing some interesting things, and a little farther down the road i spot a small sign situated at the road with steps leading down to a small building. [picture of the sign](https://imgur.com/pkuf375) cool, it's a meditation garden open to anyone from noon to sunset, and it was a few hours before sunset. perfect! i walked in and it led me to a beautiful area full of plant life, some bunnies bunnies, chirping birds, a perfectly light breeze, and a small hut and a bench to sit at and think. on the side of the bench was a folder holding a notebook which contained hundreds of little messages, drawings, etc. from people who have stumbled across this garden. i sat there for about an hour going through the entire journal and read some amazing things. there were adventurers who stumbled upon this place by accident, families who heard about it from friends, amazing artists who wrote beautiful poems about the garden, and plenty of kids drawings. there was also a mini book containing a bunch of poems picked from numerous past journals. apparently this place has existed for quite some time. the area just had a certain peaceful feeling to it. as i sat there and read through the book, it was the calmest i had felt in a long time. i tend to be an anxious person that worries about things for no reason, but there i felt at peace with myself. i left a note on an empty page towards the back of the journal along with the date, but i won't say what i wrote down here since i feel like that would defeat the purpose in a way. [video of the meditation garden and journal](https://imgur.com/hnem2gb) anyways, that's gotta be one of my most interesting finds at an attractor. it was completely unexpected, but when i found it i knew it was the perfect place for me to be at that time. i had recently been getting into meditation before that point and have been going through some things, so in that moment it felt like some sort of gift to have discovered it. without the fatum project, i never would have come across it."

first time trying the bot. results inside!,2019-08-20,had a 2.57 attractor not far from me. girlfriend and i went. it was by a set of active train tracks. sadly the actual point was in the brush and its 0125 here so we didnt expoing too far into it. however. on the way back we both noticed a feeling. she started acting a little off and i asked her and she said she was feeling observed my hair was on end and i had some crazy goose bumps. i think this was a great intro to this experience and i will be trying again during daylight hours. very interesting.
interesting set of 6 attractor points,2019-08-20,"inspired by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/randonauts/comments/cq2imu/randonauts_sticker_the_world_attractor_point/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x), i asked the bot for 6 attractors at once, on a 1km radius around my location at that time. the first one was in a big, old building, as seen in picture 1. what struck me was the gate, which looked, in my mind, similar to the image of the bot on telegram. i took it as a good sign - i was at the entrance towards the rabbit hole in reality. (gate in the picture) \- attractor 1: radius: 42m, power: 3.16, z-score: 4.37 the second attractor was 2 gates to the right of the first attractor. that seemed convenient to me. \- attractor 2: radius: 45m, power: 2.73, z-score: 3.93 the 3rd attractor was inside a fenced area (not sure what was inside, but i couldn't get in. \- attractor 3: radius: 130m, power 1.43, z-score: 3.64 the 4th attractor was inside the same fenced area, really close to the 3rd one. i managed to take a photo over the fence, in the direction of the attractor. \- attractor 4: radius: 88m, power: 1.68, z-score: 3.63 the 5th attractor was in the back garden of a construction-related business, where i understand there is sort of a motel. i was facing the front of the business building and looked to the left, and i saw the big building from the first attractor. it brought me back. \- attractor 5: radius: 33m, power: 3.28, z-score: 3.59 the 6th attractor was in the same back garden as the fifth, closer to the neigboring garden, in the direction of the first attractor, with its big building. here's what i could see, from the location of the sixth attractor, looking towards the first attractor. \- attractor 6: radius: 49m, power: 2.37, z-score: 3.59 my thoughts: \- the gate reminding me instantly of the bot's picture on telegram was a very good sign, it gave me wonderful vibes, like i was in sync with this instrument and connected to the probability \- it seemed to me that the 6 attractors came in pairs, with pair 1 and pair 3 very close together. \- it seems to me that the 2 attractors in each pair overlap (they are very close together and the radius of each one is big enough) -&gt; what does this mean? is the area where they overlap more interesting? how can we calculate the z-score and power of the area where they overlap? \- i couldn't actually stand in any of the centers of the attractors, because they were on private properties, but i was in the radius of each of them, being at the gate. &amp;#x200b; what do you make of all of this? tl;dr: out of 6 attractor points generated at once, first 2, next 2 at last 2 were very close together, and the first and last pair were also very close together; also, the gate in the first attractor reminded me of the bot image on telegram."

"adventure halted by points being in private properties, so focused on journey on my first experience.",2019-08-21,"hey, still wrapping my head around this app, and learning the discourse behind these explorations. but here is my first adventure with this concept. i am unfortunately stuck in the suburbs with my family until my finances and job situation sees a light. i go crazy by the end of the week because i am away from my friends and city. so the surroundings are basic american suburbs. i decided to take a break from my errands, and explore what i deem as a boring environment. i punch in a coordinate and started walking. essentially the three places i went to, i couldn't reach because it was someone's backyard. i was not dissapointed however, since i knew this already, but wanted to explore regardless. but one thing i realized is that, of my entire childhood to high school, i've never once walked that direction. because it was midday, traffic was 0 and no one was in their homes, the world felt empty. so i imagined that i was in a scenario where the collective suburb population ran away like in those apocalyptic movies. it just rained too, so it felt incredibly surreal for such a common setting. i pretended i was a camera, and just experienced my surroundings. oh and i discovered turkeys trying to be dominating in someone's yard. it was a simple feeling and journey, but it was incredibly peaceful. if anything i'm using this to break out of the prison i built for myself. that walk felt like an achievement, instead of having to go to the local park every day and it feeling like a chore. i guess its also my love for open world games, exploring a new undiscovered part of the map, and seeing what unique surroundings there are. interestingly each new attractor was exactly in a backyard, so i might try this in the city tomorrow, and explore a little with friends. excited to have"

coincidence?,2019-08-21,"just downloaded telegram 30 mins ago. after struggling to get it started, i cycled through a few /getpoints which were in some interesting spots but mostly deep into fields (cows). my first interesting one was in a field i had been in a few years ago with a friend. we were hunting for liberty caps and found a spot to sit down and rest. the marker was more or less right were we sat. this doesnt seem that interesting at first but that day is quite a vivid memory. i went again this time with /getvoid and the marker was nearly right on top of my ex-girlfriends house. this is freaky to me as at first i was skeptical of this whole thing but is this just a coincidence? i have no interest of visiting either of these markers for obvious reasons, the second being where my ex lives... plus its a cul de sac. just thought id share my initial experiences with the app and hope to post some visits soon. please share any similar experiences you may have had."
first randoventure,2019-08-21,"its so funny cause when i first came across randonauting it was on twitter and i just got lost here on reddit and ended up being here on reddit, okay so fast forward to this story: so every time i set to get an attractor or whatever itll pin be to either someones front house or literally a middle of a damn lake, so i would keep retrying itll just keep sending me to houses, im not gonna be crazy and walk on someones back yard so ill just usually drive by or try and catch something similar, but it would be nothing similar. until this one time me and my best friend went on a randoventure and i was driving and randomly set to get attractor and it located me to this cemetery, i got super excited (sounds bad i know) but it wasnt finally a home or something so were driving and sadly were pulling up to the cemetery and the gate was closed and locked and i got so upset it was the worst thing ever.. does anyone else get house locations? or is it just me...."
this was scary,2019-08-22,"i made the mistake of doing this after sunset. i followed the directions and it sent me down a steep, curvy hill in the woods. it wanted me to continue straight but that was blocked off so i turned left and ended up at someones house and they came up behind me as i was turning around and asking what i was doing back there because there was only one house there. she was instantly relieved when she realized it was another woman driving and not some man at her house in the dark. i told her what i was trying to do and she acted like there was no way to get back to the point i needed to get to. the whole drive was scary. on the way back some asshole drove on my ass up that hill with his brights on. this trip, not worth it. i may try again somewhere else in the day."

first trip!,2019-08-23,did my first randonaut exploration and it lead me on a nice walk through my neighborhood. the air smelt like i should be at a family cookout/graduation party/friends pool. it was nice. what was cool was that the point was in the back of my neighborhood in an secluded area that i've often dreamt about. the houses are all exactly the same ( that type of new development neighborhood with minimal trees). it always gives me an eerie vibe. the attractor was located in dense woods in my neighbors backyard so i couldn't find a way in. got as close as i could without looking creepy. hopefully something more exciting happens next time but i'm definely intrigued it lead me to this spot. i hope i dream about it again soon!

first trip. intention set around what we really need in our lives. we found traditional cure for evil eye,2019-08-24,"i decided to go for my first trip with two close friends of mine. we all believe there is a higher power (whatever kind it is) and are quite fascinated by signs and synchronicity. they are the kind of people to share that kind of experience. we decided to ask for an attractor point in order to find answers on what we really need in this moment to move on in our lives. we do different jobs as freelancers but we work in the same field, doing highly creative projects together. the very first attractor point (4.46) was located in an industrial area not far from my house. i drove there to find a pretty interesting abandoned shed. we were all like oh cool, thats beautiful but there is no particular meaning in all this. until i looked at the ground and saw heaps of coarse salt. coarse salt, especially when spread in front of doors and gates, is the traditional southern italian cure for the evil eye. for those who might not know, the evil eye is a curse cast by a malevolent glare to cause harm. there is no reason for that heaps of salt to be there. no reason at all: its abandoned, its summer time and 35 degrees... i dont know wether the message is i need protection or im already safe from the [coarse salt](https://imgur.com/fvwp8gz)evil eye. either way, we felt kind of relieved and protected."
synchronicity scavenger hunt challenge,2019-08-24,"if you guys remember the owl experiment, which lead to the synchronicity scavenger hunt challenge, we have a winner! basically a bunch of people were finding owl related stuff at attractor points (i still am!) and we actually noticed that one of our devs had coincidentally placed an owl statue sitting on the fatum server (he put it there while building a shelf and didn't think about it.) so we theorized the possibility of some owl waves or something influencing the fatum bot and sending people to owl stuff. [so what we did was put a secret object on the fatum bot server](https://i.imgur.com/hk2eja9.png), encrypted a picture of it, and asked people to try and find that object and post it in their reports to see if the object on the server and an object found in a randonaut adventure would coincide. if anyone completed the synchronicity scavenger hunt i would send them some free merch. no one found the salt in the time frame allotted, so obviously this isnt verifying anything, [but today someone posted a report about finding salt](https://www.reddit.com/r/randonauts/comments/cumg9q/first_trip_intention_set_around_what_we_really/), and i thought that was pretty fun. . time for another one! **synchronicity scavenger hunt challenge** at this time i will be starting another synchronicity scavenger hunt challenge. i'm putting an unknown object on the fatum bot server, and only i will know what the object is. if someone posts a report that includes an object similar to the one sitting on the server, you'll win a bunch of stickers, a t-shirt, and a copy of randonaut reader zine! obviously this may involve some interpretation and i'll be the final judge of what qualifies, but go out and try to find something similar to the object sitting on the server! i am willing to give some hints maybe since this is just for fun. &amp;#x200b; /u/aesthella please email [comrade@randonauts.com](mailto:comrade@randonauts.com) for some free merch for completing the challenge! &amp;#x200b; [https://www.reddit.com/r/randonauts/comments/c2ah6y/talking\_to\_a\_randonauts\_dev\_about\_the\_owl\_meme/](https://www.reddit.com/r/randonauts/comments/c2ah6y/talking_to_a_randonauts_dev_about_the_owl_meme/) [https://www.reddit.com/r/randonauts/comments/c96sz2/owl\_experiment/](https://www.reddit.com/r/randonauts/comments/c96sz2/owl_experiment/)"
hit a wall,2019-08-24,"tried randonauting for the first time today... first few attractor points were all in the ocean ( i live by the beach) i failed repeatedly to get an attractor point with a power higher than 2 that wasn't in the ocean, so finally settled for one... it took me up this steep road to a part of the city i've never been to, and into an apartment complex and to an alley ending in a blank gray cement wall. i find this disturbing and hope it means nothing. at least the view on the way home was nice..."
any advice?,2019-08-24,"alright guys, so im new to randonaut adventures and for some context, i live in a rural area. i set the fatum bot 15000 meters(15 kilometres)which spans to the nearest town. so, as you could imagine, the places it had led me were - yes you guessed it! farmers fields that i had no business being in. so i decided to try again in town, even in town - it had led me out of town, to a farmers field (although i will say the attractor point was over 4). is there any possible significance of these fields? i mean, i know in an ideal world we would go into the field and actually get to the attractor point, but from what i could see, there wasnt much going on. one more place it had led me was a house, and on the house, it had the number 1503. and thats it. thats pretty much all i got outta my first randonaut adventure. im feeling kind of bummed about it, but i know its one of those things we have to keep an open mind about. any advice?"
"first trip. intention ""hey fatum show me something mathematical or scientific if i should keep doing this""",2019-08-24,"okay so this is my first reddit post and today was my first time trying out the fatum bot. i'm not necessarily a super skeptic or mathematically inclined or anything, but i wanted to set an intention that would prove to myself that randonauting is something i want to actually spend any time doing. i generated an attractor with a power level of 4.87 (which i guess is pretty high) so i said fuck it and drove off in the work van to the spot. i thought at first it was taking me to a playground in a neighborhood that i've driven past before but the exact spot is in a wooded area down a gravelly trash-strewn back alley/driveway leading down behind a couple of older kinda creepy looking houses on a dead-end street. the driveway is connected to a parking lot behind a now vacant pizza restaurant which at first i paid no attention cause uh yeah. i pulled into the parking lot and sat there in the van wondering if i should walk down someone's driveway in broad daylight and felt the despair meme kicking in. there were also some kids playing out in front of the houses on the dead in street and i was not about to walk down their driveway and into the woods behind their house. i thought of taking to take a pic of the alley but didn't want to look like a creeper in a van taking pictures with a bunch of kids around. screw this i am out. i pulled the van around to leave and oh shit this vacant pizza restaurant was [pi pizza](https://pi-pizza.com/) emblazoned with big ass greek letter mathematical pi signs all over it, weird. i immediately thought of the movie [pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pi_(film)) a super freaky neo-noir film about a math genius guy losing his damn mind obsessing over pi and the golden mean and how numbers connect to everything. i snapped a crappy pic while driving out and after looking at it more noticed more high strangeness with the real estate sign ""scout realty group"" with a map navigational arrow inside the 'o'. our area code here in st.louis is 314 the first three numbers of pi and of course why they picked the clever name pi pizza. when i got home i googled ""pi and quantum physics"" and found some more interesting stuff about how in 2015 some scientists found pi in the [""calculations for excited energy states of electrons in an](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ezp4na/for-the-first-time-physicists-derive-pi-from-quantum-mechanics)[ atom.""](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ezp4na/for-the-first-time-physicists-derive-pi-from-quantum-mechanics) so i suppose i have now convinced myself to keep randonauting even though i didn't make it to the actual attractor point in the woods down the sketchy ass gravel drive. maybe we are living in a damn simulated reality. i kinda want to go back and try and check out those woods and see what else i find... thanks if you read all this. my hope in making this post is that maybe someone smarter than me might have some better insight on how pi, the energy states of electrons, quantum attractor points, and blah blah blah kabbalah and everything else are all connected ;) &amp;#x200b; &amp;#x200b; [pi pizza](https://i.redd.it/d8uvdwvc0bi31.jpg) &amp;#x200b; [ida attractor](https://i.redd.it/7xxy21prkbi31.jpg)"

rotting mushrooms,2019-08-24,"wednesday, a friend and i decided to try a attraction point. we started on a walk in the city, and found ourselves in a pretty cool part of the city that i've never seen before. i'm currently looking to moving, so i kept an eye on apartments in that area. we got to the point, and after picking up some trash, i found a ssn form, which i thought could be the event here. but what was really weird were a patch of rotting mushrooms. i never saw mushrooms close to death and after observing this, we got lunch which was really close to the point. after that, my friend and i went to my parents home where my mom was cleaning up the fridge, and the mushrooms she found were going bad. it looked exactly like the mushrooms we found on the lawn! we acknowledged this interesting synch. &amp;#x200b; this was really interesting. i'm still really thrown off by how uncanny those mushrooms were rotting. although probably different types of mushrooms, they were oozing and looked incredibly gross. i'm currently learning about the fungus, and am fascinated by these things!"
1st experience,2019-08-24,"&amp;#x200b; sorry for any formatting issues, this is my first ever post or reddit. i finally decided to take my first randonaut trip last night. i live in a residential area but am not too far from farm land. i set my radius to 1000 m because i wanted to be within walking distance from my house. i set an intention of ""show me what i need to see"" and hit up the bot. the first two attractor points had a power less than 2 so i decided to try a /getvoid. i received a coordinate with a power of 3.14 and we went on our way. the walk to the location was less than .5 mile but my partner started talking about how he wished he went to the restroom before we embarked. we made a couple jokes about his intention being to find a universal bathroom at whatever ""portal"" we ended up at. not even a couple hundred feet later, we see a porta potty on the street we were walking towards (this was about 500 ft from the official location we were meant to go to). it could just be a funny coincidence but i am chalking it up to synchronicity. we finally got to the place and it was just a typical residential home towards the end of a cul-de-sac. the house 2 doors down had the loudest crickets/cicadas in the entire neighborhood. we thought it was eerie that it was getting louder the closer we were getting to our final destination. the house had a boat in the driveway that had the words ""tracker"" on it and on the sidewalk was an rv parked that was named ""outlook"" with logo that reminds me of a bird. each license plate near that house had at least one 5 on it, the main plate being 555ckk. we noticed a lot of 5's throughout our walk. we felt like a bunch of weirdos creeping around the residential area late at night and i think the owner of the rv came out after i took a flash photo of it so we left and moved onto the second point. this one was a /getattractor point, power of 3.78 and we went on our way. i was not able to get to the exact spot but it led us to a children's park tucked into a apartment complex close to our home. i had never even knew this park existed even though we had a friend who used to live there. the only thing that stood out to me was this congregation of three trees, each had wiring attached to hang lights off of. it legit looked like a weird portal- i will put all photos below. anyways- from those two spots i kinda pieced together that maybe the universe is trying to tell me to change my outlook on life to be less serious/ more childlike? i also looked up the number 5 in numerology and there was a lot of stuff that stood out to me. i could be reading into it but i feel like that is the point. i will do a little further research to see if there are any esoteric meanings to the other symbols we saw along the way (a giant trout fish mailbox, look up the numerology meanings of the house numbers or license plates, etc.). i will definitely continue to do this and see what else i can find along the way. https://i.redd.it/e6ch9gev6gi31.jpg https://i.redd.it/357anhev6gi31.jpg https://i.redd.it/owzxsgev6gi31.jpg https://i.redd.it/t20ueiev6gi31.jpg"

quick write up of my experiences today,2019-08-25,"first day off in a while, went randonauting with two friends on two different adventures. &amp;#x200b; [first point lead us to this guy meditating by the lake](https://i.imgur.com/flz91rj.png) we chatted about the global consciousness project, and he randomly mentioned something about giants skeletons being buried in the area, which was interesting because me and my friend had just been talking about giants skeletons. later that day i went with another friend and found this [rattlesnake](https://i.imgur.com/whal60y.png) which if you remember from my past adventures is significant from finding the snake pendant across from the legendary drum artifact and almost stepping on a rattlesnake when i went back to that point. actually, [i found a dead snake during the previous adventure that day with my other friend too](https://i.imgur.com/cixid5m.png). my friend found a magic 8 ball that looked like a pirate skull and had pirate phrases. quantum divining device, score."

my first experience--part two of the journey ft. despair meme,2019-08-26,"earlier i posted a picture in regards to the very first point i visited. i tried to find a chain from it but no other point generated **(bummer!)** &amp;#x200b; in this post i want to explore the last part of my day, which included a pair of points generated from a location different than my first location. the attraction point was fine. i was excited and the place had a calm feel, almost lonely. the void point was similar in regards to the journey, but once i turned into the last street and into the off-road path it became completely different. once i hit the gravel road i began to feel a little anxious but it was nothing extreme. at a certain point on that path (which wasn't very long to begin with) i hit a curved section, which had a wooden sign that seemed to belong to an old ranch/farm, but nothing farm/ranch related in sight, after seeing the sign, i looked beyond and saw the house at the end of the road, from what i can remember it had a single tree in front of it (although the gravel road was lined by trees on one side), and a parked truck with a boat attached to it. this specific sight immediately gave me **despair meme feels**, it was so intense i almost want to call it a panic. i turned my car around as fast as i possibly could, and something ~~told me~~ **warned** me not to look side to side, keep my eyes straight, even down if i wanted, but not left or right. as soon as my car was back on the main road, despair meme feels vanished almost as quickly as they had appeared. i really truly hope i never experience despair meme to this extent again. you better believe i'm going to keep randonauting though!"
first trip,2019-08-27,"sorry about format, im typing this on mobile. also, this might be longer than the avarage post. sorry in advance. okay so a little backstory first. im in florence for the semester, its my first few days and im staying at an airbnb for 2 weeks and in the meantime i search for a place a can rent for a longer term. story starts today. i was in search for a supermarket to get some supplies, turns out the supermarket i found was 2km away from where im staying. i reach the supermarket, get my shit and leave, i look at my phone. 19:40. i think okay now i have some time to do my first randonaut experience so i walk back to where florences city wifi is strongest, near piazza del duomo, so i walk back those 2km, after i arrive i chill for a bit near the piazza since it was a long walk and ive been walking a lot this past few days. now my trip begins. at 20:02 i set radius for 2500m and send location inside il duomo, which is great because this means 2500m keeps inside the historical center of florence since il duomo is pretty centralized. now i set my intention... show me something meaningful that i can interpret into my life. i type /getattractor, subconsciously im thinking please dont be near the supermarket i just came from since that would mean i just have to walk back somewhere i just explored. well guess what, it sent the fucking attractor point just 50m away from the supermarket. literally the block next to it...power: 1.50. so im like fuuuck im really not feeling it, so im doubting if i should get another attractor point. i almost did, but i said fuck it and got on my way. btw the exact attractor point was inside what looked like a private property from the map. after 15-20 minutes of walking and my feet hurting, i get there. pretty avarage block, nothing special. attactor point was inside a house, it seemed like no one was there. blinds closed, lights off, not abandoned by any means. nothing on the walls. nothing. then i see it, right in front of the door, on the floor. it was the thing that most stood out to me for some reason, it was a symbol. it was this small sewer thingy with some kind of symbol on it. (image in the comments) symbol looked cool, and i didnt know what it was. since i didnt have wifi atm i was thinking on investigating when i got to my airbnb. a bit disappointed on my first trip tbh, then i start walking back to the center in search for something to eat, halfway there just as im walking i look left and theres the same big sign inside a restaurant, painted at the cashiers desk. so at this moment im hooked, wtf is that sign? i keep walking and i see it again in a small souvenir store, looks like a coat of arms, because i saw it with firenze (florence in italian) on top of it. so i get to a restaurant, order a pizza and start searching on my phone. coat of arms of the city of florence, a fleur-de-lis, or florentine lily, the lily refers to the flower of iris that grew naturally on the walls and hills around florence now i search the meaning behind the flower, iris flower. it takes its name from the greek word iris, meaning rainbow, also the greek goddess of the rainbow. synchronicity starts... the landlady of the airbnb im staying at is called iris, shes been kind to me, and since we are both latinos we share that connection. also, the first night staying in the airbnb i just didnt feel like booking it was the right choice and i honestly regretted it, i couldnt sleep that first night. this experience talked to me on different levels, this meant to me that it was all good and i had nothing to worry about, as if the universe was telling me to trust the process. also, the rainbow part is very significant to me since it has something to do with a very profound experience i had involving psychedelics, light and rainbows. also this past few weeks ive been very interested in the electromagnetic spectrum, and how humans are only able to percieve a small portion of it, visible light, which are the beautiful colors we experience. honestly, this is an experience i needed, thank you randonauts community, keep doing your thing guys, and thanks for reading! cant wait to try this more!!"
my friend who is moving to hawaii sent me on my first expedition,2019-08-27,"yesterday i messaged a close friend of mine about some things that i had noticed while meditating. when i messaged him he responded immediately surprised, and told me that he had just been thinking about me and was about to message me. he then proceeded to tell me about randonauting and the theories and concepts behind it. after some discussion i set up the telegram bot and got started. it gave me a point near by that i've driven past several times. it had a power of 1.91 and a z-score of 4.06. when i arrived it was where i had thought it was, an old abandoned lot with a run down building and big concrete drains laid out in the lot. i didn't explore the abandoned building or the concrete drains because i'm pretty sure the lot was owned by the concrete drain manufacturer on the other side of the road. i walked about 15 feet from where i parked which was the point and there on the ground pressed into the mud was a yellow hawaiian flower necklace or ""lei"" i picked it up and put it in the floor board of my truck and left. i sent the picture to my friend and he saw it as a synchronisity or a meaningful coincidence. maybe as a sign or omen of his future. i told him that if that was the case he should also know that the lot smelled like dog shit and the lei had been trampled in mud."
glittery peace rock and totem pole,2019-08-27,"we did two points this weekend and ended up with a glittery peace rock. (**btw if anyone knows how you can switch the orientation of a photograph once you upload it here, please let me know.**) point one: we drove to a fishing village about 30 miles from our house. we stopped at a coffee shop to generate a point and i bought a snack bar. when i opened it, i laughed because on the back it said ""an alternate snack from an alternate universe."" and we hadn't even generated the point yet! the point was a low power (under 2) but we decided to check it out anyway. &amp;#x200b; *processing img p4spucz281j31...* we were enjoying the walk through the village to an area near the tiny post office. it was a field with some turkeys, and someone's yard was nearby that had some interesting art and figurines. i took a few photos and they have a weird shadow. i attribute the shadows to the fog, the breeze, and the fact that my cell phone sucks. (maybe it's a strand of my hair?) there were no eerie feelings - we were having a lot of fun exploring. &amp;#x200b; *processing img 3peuw05d81j31...* *processing img vlm9uw4d81j31...* &amp;#x200b; across the street was a huge totem pole. it was in someone's private yard so we couldn't investigate. &amp;#x200b; *processing img z8vgmhng81j31...* also across the street was what looked like an abandoned church, but i'm not 100% sure. there was a plastic dispenser for visitor information and wedged inside i found this glittery peace stone: &amp;#x200b; *processing img 8jd5a3bi81j31...* *processing img ahgom4bi81j31...* then we generated a second attractor point, and this one had a higher power over 4. point two: the point was offshore. we ended up on an undeveloped beach with some surfers, a couple of family groups picnicking, and two groups of people on horses. we got directly across from the offshore point, so from our position on the beach we were about 1/4 mile away. we could see a buoy and a small boat out there. nothing too interesting on the beach. there were several dead seabirds, but that's pretty normal for that area. we snagged a loose plastic bag and headed back home. *processing img oscw51bm81j31...* *processing img hauashbm81j31...* super happy with our glitter-rock find!"

first time - curiosity killed clover the cat?,2019-08-28,"hi! sorry, this is long, i'm new here and new to reddit but i was very amped to get home and share this with you guys!!! so, earlier this evening i read this article: [https://theoutline.com/post/7881/i-became-a-randonaut-to-try-to-glitch-the-simulation-and-all-i-got-was-a-bottle-of-pee?utm\_source=&amp;zd=2&amp;zi=icekhgit](https://theoutline.com/post/7881/i-became-a-randonaut-to-try-to-glitch-the-simulation-and-all-i-got-was-a-bottle-of-pee?utm_source=&amp;zd=2&amp;zi=icekhgit) this is super up my alley.. so of course i download the app, message the bot (with zero intention) just to see what this was all about... without really understanding the ideas behind it. the first attractor i got was a little further away than my (at this point mild) curiosity wanted to walk to, so i set the radius to the lowest possible number. the second attractor was super close to my old house, and in the courtyard of a u shaped apartment building i have walked by a zillion times. i was like, eh... been there before. so i asked for a third attractor point, which was squarely in the middle of the river. at this point the sun is going down and i've been sitting on my couch messaging my friend about all of this, debating if i'm really interested enough to walk to the 2nd point. i end up on this reddit and start to get creeped out by the whole ""despair-meme"" thing, but i decide i have enough time before it gets dark to do a walk by and stop wondering. soooo i grab my keys, walk out my front door and there's a rabbit right outside the door, staring at me. i see rabbits all the time, and usually just take it as a nice sign that things are well in the world. i will say, my bff says she sees way more rabbits when she's with me, but maybe its just that i always stop and point to them. no big deal, bunny just weirdly close to my house, wishing me well on my journey. short walk to the spot. the power of this attractor is 5.03 and the z-score is 3.53. the dot is basically inside the foyer of this building, so i walk as close as i can get since i don't live there and look in the corner. there's a business card. i get nervous that i'm somehow going to get locked out when i get home (didn't, lol). &amp;#x200b; ![img](h5rxr0yvg3j31) &amp;#x200b; ![img](bmipj67xg3j31) i'm like, well ok, i picked up some litter, time to go home... but first i walk around the block to the alley behind the building. right where the dot is showing, there's a dumpster and a recycling bin, and something white smushed into the dirt right at the base of the building. some lady was trying to park and i felt like a weirdo loitering but i picked up the white thing... &amp;#x200b; ![img](eg67ipu6h3j31) totally had no idea what it was... little felt pouch stitched together... i'm like, oh god what's inside this thing, is this full of mystery cooties, what did i just grab...i flipped it over... &amp;#x200b; ![img](c8w0le9bh3j31) a tiny envelope! i decided that this is someone's handmade cat toy for a cat named clover, because i have no other ideas. it has a little bit of stuffing but i didn't cut it open or anything. any thoughts? i have a little side project making greeting cards and my logo is a little white envelope with a heart (basically like the emoji).. so... that's kind of a fun synch. walked home thinking about this whole experience... crossing the street to my house i see something moving out of the corner of my eye... it was a rabbit that appeared out of nowhere and crossed the street with me right to my front door again. the end (for now...)"
are there any experiential differences between visiting attractors and voids?,2019-08-28,"i think this whole concept is really neat btw and i plan to visit my nearest attractor during lunch, but i'm not really sure if i should be visiting attractors or voids. i want to do both and see what happens. i know it's early days but are there any common themes of experience between the two? e.g. one where you get the synchronicity and strange coincidences, and one where nothing happens/you get glitches?"

"first trip today, im hooked",2019-08-29,"i am immensely intrigued by all of this. my emotional state has been in a real rut and i needed something to get me out. i decided to take a trip with the intention of ""what do i need?"" in terms of healing, or the next step on my path. the first point i went to was in a private housing development in a neighborhood nearby, on a a road id never been down called ""arrowhead drive"". there were several other things nearby named arrowhead as well. i thought this was neat, but didnt really see anything else nearby looked interesting. i decided not to go into the housing development (despair?) and generated the next point. the next point brought me to a cul-de-sac. the point itself was in someones fenced backyard (i couldnt see in), but in the front yard of one of the houses nearby was a ring of cantaloupe-sized chunks of obsidian, with a few scraggly plants in the center as if it were a planter. id never seen chunks of obsidian that large before, and hadnt even really thought theyd exist. this was cool but i wasnt really sure what to do with it either. i didnt really know where to go after this. i didnt generate another point, and i dont remember how i picked which way i was going, but i just started driving. many times i thought about pulling over to generate a point but didnt, as it didnt feel right. in a short time i game to an area i didnt recognize, even though it wasnt too far from home. i noticed some beautiful trees and lawn off to the side of me and so i pulled in to check it out - and it was a park id never been to! id thought id completely explored all the parks nearby but here was this huuuuge park that id somehow missed. it had a very different vibe than most of the other parks nearby too, open field with trees that looked shaped (but werent) and very very green grass that somehow didnt seem irritated or mowed. a stream ran through the park, with an arched bridge over it. i explored the park a bit but didnt find anything interesting in it. i think the park itself was what i felt drawn to. the brief time in nature really helped my mental state and reminded me that i should make an effort to get nature exposure more often. in retrospect i think this was the natural ending of this journey, but i kept going. i think i learned something about how the system works by doing this because it certainly was trying to show me what i needed, i was just too dense! i generated another point while sitting in the park, with the same/similar intention - what do i need next/the most?. the first point looked like it was in a neighborhood nearby, and was actually back the way i came a bit. i didnt want to go that way, so i generated another one. this one was in the opposite direction, so i went there. didnt see too much along the way (a chiropractor? naaah...), and it ended up being an apartment complex. i didnt know what to make of it - it didnt seem to have a name and there wasnt anything interesting nearby. at this point i decided id kind-of head towards home, not having anything better to do (i did not make the connection with apartment complex and home at the time). i ended up using a side street to turn around that looked interesting, so i went up it a ways and found... another apartment complex that caught my eye (yeah, im dense), and, a ways down a no outlet road, a whole section of new houses tucked away up on top of a hill. one in particular stood out, a massive two-story 3-car garage neo-mcmansion with enormous trees behind it. i didnt get any despair feeling from being there. all i could notice was the big-ness of it, really. the road ended in the driveway of another new house where i turned around and went home without any side trips. a big ol house? yeah, the universe was telling me to go home. i shoulda listened back at the park! ive also now just realized the connection between the first two points. arrowheads are usually made from obsidian! im wondering if this relates to my query because (if you believe in such things, and im guessing the people in this sub do) obsidian is a grounding stone, good for sucking up negative energies in much the same way that putting bare feet on grass is. i definitely got the medicine i was looking for when i found that park, i really want to go back to it and spend some time there. even though the park wasnt actually a generated point, i feel that i found it in much the same way. im actually used to wandering or using my intuition or body-cues to tell me which way to go when im not sure what to do. this was certainly a worthy find and the journey was a ton a fun. im hooked!"

second trip - 3rd attractor ended up inside my aunts house!,2019-08-29,"today i had the free time to go on a small adventure and i was pleasantly surprised. i got and attractor point starting from my house (1000 radius), ended up going to a neighborhood close by down the street. nothing in particular that i noticed about the area, so i got my second attractor from that spot and it lead me to a nature reserve across the street, i used to go there a lot but i hadnt been in a while. i couldnt go exactly too my point because it was in the middle of the marsh water but i was relatively close. heres where the switch up happens, i kept trying to get my 3rd point but two of them kept going deeper into the water so i didnt take those. i ended up getting in my car to go back home but just before i left the nature reserve and set my radius to 3000m and pulled in another attractor point, this time it ended up in a neighborhood area. as i get closer to the point on the gps im lead down a very familiar path, and before i know it my attractor point was right inside my aunts house. at first i wasnt going to knock and go inside just so i can reach my point, but then coincidentally my uncle was taking there new puppy out to the bathroom on the same side of the street i pulled up at. it was very nice i got to explain to them how the fatum bot worked, didnt go too deep in the reality shifting part but definitely told them its something i really enjoy. my first randonaut adventure was also 3 days ago, it was interesting looking back to see how cool this really is, im very grateful i found this subreddit . tldr : 3rd attractor point i switched up the radius to a larger scale, which ended in me pulling up at my aunts house coincidentally at the same they were taking there dog out to the bathroom."

simulation thoughts,2019-08-29,"hi, i'm new to randonauts and have been reading posts for a few days. i also read this article: [https://theoutline.com/post/7881/i-became-a-randonaut-to-try-to-glitch-the-simulation-and-all-i-got-was-a-bottle-of-pee](https://theoutline.com/post/7881/i-became-a-randonaut-to-try-to-glitch-the-simulation-and-all-i-got-was-a-bottle-of-pee) which gave me a good overview. i know that it's not just about ""glitching the simulation"", there are other reasons to be a randonaut. i have a few thoughts and questions: 1. if we are in a simulation of reality, do most randonauts think of it as a hybrid simulation, like the matrix or ""brains in a vat"", or is it more likely to be a full virtual simulation? 2. if it is a full virtual simulation, which i think is the more likely case, there are many possibilities: \- the real world/universe/reality that contains our simulation may have entirely different natural laws than ours. \- there may be multiple levels of simulation, that is, there could be simulations that are advanced enough to contain their own simulations (simulations all the way down!). 3. if we are in a full virtual simulation of reality, then wouldn't the fatum project's quantum random number generator also be part of the simulation? if that is the case, then the simulation could have control over the random numbers generated and only be creating the illusion that the location coordinates are random. thus it may not be possible to glitch the simulation. anyway, just some of my thoughts. \- vfa"

"""it is true that the operations of walking on can be traced on city maps in such a way as to transcribe their paths (here well-trodden, there very faint) and their trajectories (going this way and not that). but these thick or thin curves only refer to the absence of what has passed by.""",2019-08-30,"i would like to introduce to this sub a chapter from michel de certeau's *the practice of everyday life*, a well-known sociological book, published in 1980, about how people use the things that institutions produce for them to use -- in this case, streets. the chapter is called [""walking in the city""](http://www.laits.utexas.edu/berlin/pdf/scholarship/de%20certeau_walking.pdf). here is the opening, to engage you before you are ready to click a link: &gt; seeing manhattan from the 110th floor of the world trade center. beneath the haze stirred up by the winds, the urban island, a sea in the middle of the sea, lifts up the skyscrapers over wall street, sinks down at greenwich, then rises again to the crests of midtown, quietly passes over central park and finally undulates off into the distance beyond harlem. a wave of verticals. its agitation is momentarily arrested by vision. the gigantic mass is immobilized before the eyes. it is transformed into a texturology in which extremes coincide - extremes of ambition and degradation, brutal oppositions of races and styles, contrasts between yesterday's buildings, already trans-formed into trash cans, and today's urban irruptions that block out its space. unlike rome, new york has never learned the art of growing old by playing on all its pasts. its present invents itself, from hour to hour, in the act of throwing away its previous accomplishments and challenging the future. a city composed of paroxysmal places in monumental reliefs. the spectator can read in it a universe that is constantly exploding. in it are inscribed the architectural figures of the *coincidatio oppositorum* formerly drawn in miniatures and mystical textures. on this stage of concrete, steel and glass, cut out between two oceans (the atlantic and the american) by a frigid body of water, the tallest letters in the world compose a gigantic rhetoric of excess in both expenditure and production. it is a very thought-provoking treatment of moving through and looking at public spaces that is difficult to summarize; but i think anyone enjoying this randonauting would find much of interest here. randonauting is in the end a method of breaking out of programmed routes and ways of looking. this book was a real level-up for me when i read it as a young punk looking for abandoned places to explore."
attractor success?,2019-08-31,"the first 3 points were off limits, so i had no choice but to avoid these. upon the 4th which i was allowed access, i was brought to a large cemetary. directed to the very edge i got out and walked to the pinpoint location on my map. nothing at all, i was staring into the woods. i start walking away and all of a sudden a car pulls up, two people get out and walk exactly to that location on my map, straight into the woods. i waited but never saw them come back out. im very interested in the results of this experiment. that was a strange occurrence for sure. to add; i got my mom to try the fatum bot out. the both of us keep getting the same coordinates of a gated water reseviour fairly deep in the woods. i refuse to trespass, though the bot refuses to give me other locations?"

another first-timer setting out,2019-08-31,"date: 28 aug 2019, my first randonauting excursion. visited three sites, two attractors followed by a void, chained. default radius. no effort at setting an intention, beyond a general desire to see whether any weirdness would emerge for me. (as someone to whom the world doesnt usually offer weirdness.) first attractor returned was weak, but it was my first ever so i wasnt going to let it go by. all sites visited by car; except for the second site i parked 50 - 100 yards away at first, preferring to make a walking approach to better scout the location. i didnt interact with anything at any of the sites. no drugs were consumed prior to setting out. overall: 10/10, would fatum again. **site 1**. weak attractor (p: 1.88, z: 4.14). location: tuxedo park, webster groves, mo. there were mushrooms. i didnt notice them at first (a consistent theme of the trip). tuxedo park, unknown to me before this, is a very early (c. 1890) commuter suburb; the street where the attractor was located terminates at the former train station. (another consistent theme: every street on this trip that hosted a point had something blocking it one way or another at the far end from where i entered.) its a hilly neighborhood with houses in a mix of styles, a number of them fine old queen anne homes dating from the founding of the suburb. houses all well kept, well set back from the street, all fronted with immaculate suburban lawns. the house roughly at the attractor site seemed in no way interesting; i carried on walking a bit further up the street toward the train station but the only thing that registered even a little unusual was a lawn sign where someone had posted invitations to some sort of neighborhood cocktail party they were throwing that night or the next. i walked back toward my car, trying to more closely locate the attractor, but ready to concede disappointment. i must have paused at the spot for a minute or two before i thought to look down. [mushrooms](https://i.redd.it/1e8dyur2mtj31.jpg) not just one or two mushrooms, but a stand of them, the caps on the largest almost a hands breadth across, on this otherwise pristine lawn. all of them firm and fresh. as if theyd all popped up at once, as if theyd all popped up between the time i first passed the lawn and when i retraced my steps back. nothing remotely similar anywhere to be seen on any of the other lawns; in fact ive never seen something like this on any recent walk ive taken in the area (i live in an adjacent inner suburb about a mile away). and that they were placed hard by a round (mushroomy?) water meter? it seemed glitchy. not deeply weird, just a little askew from what youd expect. i figured id found my maiden anomaly, for what it was worth. **site 2**. attractor (p: 2.13, z: 4.18). location: brentwood, mo. a cul-de-sac. i parked in the only spot of shade available, very near the attractor. the point seemed to be directly between two houses, one at the end of the block proper, the other the first house on the turnaround. my attention was taken by an odd path between thema narrow, irregular asphalt path snaking over to the adjacent block. it seemed not to belong to either property. i happened to look back as i walked onto the path and saw a brentwood cop car glide past into the turnaround, which i admit spooked me a little. the path thoughwhich wasnt really offering me anything, anomaly-wisewas taking me away from the attractor. i came back toward the front of the two houses, again trying to refine my position, and it was only then that i really registered what was on the lawn of the first house, the one right before the turnaround. [dreamweaver](https://i.redd.it/bwl2lvt9mtj31.jpg) i meanright? how much comment does this need? without laboring it though, i want to point out how this site and the first seem to be entangled with one another: * my first trip first shows me anomalous mushrooms, followed by a childs dreamcastle tent, aerialist equipment, a freaking ladder into the sky? the suggestion of psychedelic whimsy is almost too much to bear. * the form of the tent itselfround, capped, a weird outgrowth on an otherwise ordinary lawnlikewise recalls the prior mushrooms; * while the star-and-heavens imagery of the tent retrospectively make that stand of mushrooms seems like nothing so much as a constellation. its all sort of light and witty, like ive unexpectedly turned over a couple of leaves in a clever, slightly druggy childrens book. **site 3**. strong void (p: 4.33, z: -4.15). location: brentwood, mo. just a quarter mile or so from the second site, on a through street temporarily blocked at the far end by construction of what looked like a school parking lot. [void apples](https://i.redd.it/xnpvsivdmtj31.jpg) i had to stare at the tree, which seemed directly on the void spot, for some time before i got what was strange about it. its hard to tell at a glance but the tree is absolutely loaded with small, ripening applesat least i think theyre apples, of a sort i used to see when i lived in chicago, though never on a tree that looked like this, this tall and straight and bushy, and never growing so thick. no other such trees to be found anywhere nearby, or any on any walk ive been in around here in the last year, nor have i ever noticed this fruit anywhere in the area before. for the third time, then, an anomalous growth, a weird fecundity, columnar, on someones front lawn. the word *cluster* to describe how the fruit hangs is inevitable, which in the trip context seems like another cosmic pun. otherwise, my first reaction was anticlimax. there were some minor, unnecessary annoyances both in getting to the site and leaving it, though its just another suburban residential block; and my mood was clouded by the time i located the point. all i saw at first was a big ugly builder-built house facing me with an ugly (new, gleaming white) half-tone denali pickup in the drive. i felt an oppressiveness looking at it. the feeling transferred to the tree, when i finally saw what i was seeing there: its height and shape and the condition of the fruit all seemed wrong, and the tree seemed somehow tortured. it took me some reflection to wonder if the void characteristic wasnt exactly in my emotional response to the scene. its notable that this was the only point that carried any strong personal content for me. i always had a sort of friendly feeling towards those tiny chicago apples, bright welcome reminders of fall coming; i should have felt the same sort of welcome here, but the feeling was only solicited to be blocked. and when i left i realized, very belatedly, that the place was *directly in back of* a place that figures in the history of my recent move back to st. louis. (that in back of theme seems to come up frequently in the discussion about void locations.) the stinger is that when i got home i did a quick bit of reading up about tuxedo park (i have a longstanding interest in the history of american suburbanism). a walking-tour pamphlet from a few years back gives a quick sketch of the lands ownership history: the land rising up along deer creek was part of louis bomparts spanish land grant, and the land south of marshall avenue was part of john sarpys. slaves tended bomparts land, and in 1845, dr. william h. brown, a virginia physician, purchased 233 acres [that would become tuxedo park] from sarpy, and his slaves *cultivated his orchards there*. that was my holy-shit moment, reading that. uncannily this years-old text is making a correspondence between the first attractor i visited and that void apple tree. as if someones hand had inserted the orchard thing there for my benefit. or as if the text had simply *emerged*, in the moment of my coming across it, from the entanglement created in the points-chaining exercise. or maybe the tree itself appeared on the site as some kind of revenant. at any event its difficult not to be tempted into thinking about reality-distortion stuff here. one last thing to note: encountering a text about slavery obviously puts the whole trip into a much darker register. its not something im inclined to trivialize, and i feel a little uneasy even bringing it up. but i do wonder if there isnt some void character here, too. maybe that's what voids are about: its a site that generates or exposes ironies, that invites critique, that points to deprivation and dispossession (places emptied of place). in particular i think im going to pay attention to whether or not void sites get associated with trauma, personal or historical (and considering trauma as something that might create its own kind of traces in the noosphere)."

1st randonaut journey,2019-09-01,"i came across a post last week about randonauts and was quite fascinated. ive always felt things were interconnected in the universe so this really excited me. today, i decided to ask for an attractor and set the intention show me something mysterious that will keep me interested in randonauts. i set my radius for 1000m and got my first attractor. it was 49m away with a power of 2.37 and a z-score of 3.60. i set out on foot and arrived in a parking lot about 15 feet from a mexican restaurant that i had eaten at before. i looked around and didnt really notice anything weird or unusual. i asked for another attractor and received one with a power of 1.46 and z-score of 3.89, it was about 130m away. i walked over there and im in the middle of another parking lot. again, i dont see anything weird or unusual, ive been in this parking lot several times before. while i was walking though, i started noticing the number 3 a lot and took note of that. by this time i had to use the bathroom and there was a beach side park across the street. i went over there and used the facilities. i decided to get another attractor from that point outside the restrooms. this time it gave me a point on the beach that had a power of 3.22 and a z-score of 4.29, it was 40m away. now, its low tide and this location would not have been accessible if the tide was not low. i start walking out on the beach, its getting muddy now but i said to myself screw it, i can wash my shoes. i get to the exact point and theres nothing there but these 3 rocks. thinking back on it i should have flipped them over but i didnt. i thought this was neat as i noticed the number 3 a lot and then at this exact spot there are these 3 medium sized rocks all a few inches from each other. ok, so my shoes are muddy and i decide to move on. i leave the park and started walking away from it. i tried getting a few more attractor points in the park but it was giving me locations covered by water. i get away from the park and decided to try a void. i get a location about 73m away with a power of 2.77 and a z-score of 4.83. i walk over there ( another parking lot ) and find a single seagull feather around the exact location of this void and a used coffee cup that i picked up and threw away. i also picked up the seagull feather and took it home. so, my adventure is over for the day but i did keep seeing a lot of the number 3 on the way home. i found it it interesting about the 3 rocks on the beach at that location and the single seagull feather at the void location. im not sure what it all means but im excited to explore more. i think next time i will set the radius bigger and drive to some locations."

1st season veteran randonaut - dick tripover - rogomono,2019-09-02,"&amp;#x200b; [field information](https://i.redd.it/6n9ruehru6k31.png) procedural generation - is a method of creating data algorithmically as opposed to manually, typically through a combination of human-generated assets and algorithms coupled with computer-generated randomness and processing power. in computer graphics, it is commonly used to create textures and 3d models. a major advantage in using it in this type of program, besides being a more scalable approach, is that it can handle large numbers of textures at once. a method of producing synthetic data is shown in u. s. app. c. 3,854, and it is referred to as a technique of ""spatial data compression"", in that the technique exploits nonlinearities in space to reduce the compression of data that would otherwise result from their generation on or near the physical data-collection system. while the foregoing disclosure has been described with reference to exemplary embodiments thereof, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various changes may be made in light of the above teachings, and that the invention as represented by the appended claims ought not to be deemed to be limited thereto. moreover, although the disclosed methods have been described as implementing one method or method of data compression and another method of data compression and/or any combination thereof, and may be implemented or employed for purposes related to creating an immersive play experience. as a main player in a challenge you have the power before challenge cards are revealed, to return any one players base to his home system. the affected player then must place all those tokens on any planet in his home system. this power has no effect on a player with 5 home bases. note that the player with his first home planet gets the power first, as he is the first player in the game to have started with a home system, and then all the players are first in the game, and finally each player with his home planet has to receive the power. note that there is no time limit to play the power. the goal of any challenge, even a single one is to get all the tokens. the only way to stop this was to use them to prevent the opponent from having access to his own bases, which would allow him to get all the tokens. if you manage to prevent the other player from having access to his home base, then it is possible to get the other player back into the game by using your power, but the tokens are still lost. what is considered to be a victory? when you roll your challenge, you can either win the game or lose the game, and depending on whether the winning or losing player was in the other player's home base, the game will end and you lose the game. the home base is always located on the map you are trying to visit. also, any items on the home base, such as cards, are worth less than their cost when the home base is on your field. if you are winning a challenge, you can buy items on the home base. as usual, a challenge to a level two challenge is worth 8 coins. if you get into a challenge to level five, you get a random item from level five. as usual, the items found in a challenge are worth double when in the home base. if there is an issue of an npc taking out a player, this person cannot use a home base in that game. history: a species with a fanatical yearning for returning home during mating season has been mutated by cosmic radiation into beings that can send both friend and foe home at desired times. the salmon hope to use their home returning abilities to shackle the universe. genius level intellect: the salmon can use their powers to make even the most well intentioned people see the truth. supervillain level intellect: the salmon are able to use their mutant powers for evil and have done so to the detriment of other species. weaknesses: the salmon are vulnerable to electromagnetic radiation and radiation poisoning. likes: a few humans dislikes: not all humans. rituals/powers/talents: salmon: all salmon possess their own unique powers with a select group of their genes being inherited for the remainder of their lifespan. this process also applies to those that were born at a different date from themselves. the salmon's super powers may be more powerful but are more random and erratic than a regular person's power. they are also considered the weakest in both the supernatural and the supernatural sub-genres. as a result, their power levels fluctuate at an incredible rate that can cause confusion. due to their chaotic nature, they are generally not well known or respected by either society or magic. despite this, they have been recognized as a powerful group of mages by the wizarding world. appearance: it is not uncommon to see the same salmon as several of its friends. it usually wears clothing made of a light fabric, sometimes a combination of cloth, cloth and the skin of another salmon. it has red and white markings on its body, while other salmon have black stripes; some salmon also use their markings in a manner that is different from one another. it has a yellow beak and two white beak plates that cover its eyes and chin. theme song [https://youtu.be/c1aaedljemm](https://youtu.be/c1aaedljemm) the river water diverts to other places to nurture central valley seeds the northern waters that sloshes desert fairways fulfill so-cal golfers needs the mighty chook, it used to run the rivers to the grounds where they spawn thin numbers, as the tributaries waned pretty soon, they'll all be gone jimmy mac runs the trawler of his father who got it passed down from his pa three closed seasons, and a banknote on his shoulder that jimmy's hidin' from the law jimmy watched, as the bulk of the fleet sold their boats or moved away but after the stroke, he promised to his father he'd do his best to stay he'd remember the days when his father used to show him how to set the temp on the gear his hand upon his shoulder, he looked out at the water said, ""son it is my fear, that you'll be the last salmon man."" you're the last salmon man you're the last salmon man you're the last salmon man, from the macgoverner clan 2010 they re-opened north cal waters to the salmon chasing slew four straight days, jimmy trolled the jagged coastline but, the fish were far and few jimmy watched as the bulk of the fleet packed their boats and moved away but on his death bed, he promised to his father he'd do his best to stay he'd remember the days when his father used to show him how to set the temp on the gear his hand upon his shoulder, he looked out at the water said, ""son it is my fear, that you'll be the last salmon man."" you're the last salmon man you're the last salmon man you're the last salmon man, from the macgoverner clan the last salmon man he's the last salmon man he's the last salmon man, from the macgoverner clan"

my first attractor story,2019-09-03,"no photos sorry. it was dark and i didnt want to use flash photography. anyways heres what went down: so my wife and i are chilling at home, smoking a little weed and talking. i tell her all about randonauts and that im gonna try it soon. why not right now? she asks. its the middle of the night we dont want to go into some random place and get stabbed, i told her. it was 11:30pm at this point. theres a bit more back and forth as i show her how the bot works, and we see that it gives us an attractor only 300m away with a power level of 1.69. i gave in since it was so close and we headed out. the attractor is at the corner of this property a little ways down from my house, a really swanky old fashioned apartment complex that wed never walked through despite living in the neighborhood for over 7 years. we entered the complex so we could get to the centre of the point which was behind hedges. well this is where it gets interesting. once we pass the hedges the whole atmosphere changed, the complex was lit by lanterns that kinda looked like the one from narnia, so the lighting is different then the street, as we walk deeper into the complex it starts raining lightly. it hadnt rained all day before that moment. we get to the corner of the property where the point is centred and theres an old collapsed gazebo there. we definitely felt a weird vibe standing there looking at it in the middle of the night in the rain. spooky. we decided to leave before someone decide we were casing apartments and called the cops or something, and as i said before we didnt take any pics for the same reason. as soon as we were 10 feet outside the hedges again the rain stopped. it blew our minds. i suggested we walk the longer way home to see if the rain started again, as its not uncommon for stop-and-start rain to happen in our area. well it never did rain again that night. literally just the 5 or 6 minutes we spent at the attractor point. my wife and i are completely hooked. were going to spend our day off chaining points and experimenting."

first trip,2019-09-03,none
first trip report (power: 0.67),2019-09-03,"background: i am, for the most part, skeptical of intention-driven traveling. i have two associate degrees (in physics and mathematics) and a bachelor's in engineering, and that scientific mindset paradoxically both discounts and supports the idea of traveling between universes. i consider this an experiment in broadening my horizons (with the added benefit of getting a bit of exercise). i am also going through a divorce due to my husband's infidelity and have been struggling with feelings of inadequacy, severe and near-constant anxiety, non-existent self-esteem, and lack of purpose. i'm pretty desperate to change my mindset, and if this type of exploration can help, so be it. for this trip, i set the intention as: freedom from fear. before the trip, i wrote: ""i am afraid and waiting for something. i don't know if it is something external or internal. \[...\] i do not know how to define myself - whether by my past or my future. if i define myself by my past, i fall into self-victimization. on the other hand, if i define myself by my future, i run the risk of measuring my worth simply by my achievements. i want to **become** not just to **achieve**."" &amp;#x200b; results: on the way to the attractor point, i picked up a piece of trash, a broken styrofoam cup that said ""extremely cold"". at the attractor point, i saw: * a car with the license plate ""berco"" * a parking post that was removed from the ground and set aside (not broken, just cast aside) * an orange parking cone set next to a tree on the way back from the attractor point, i saw a car that looked exactly like my soon-to-be-ex-husband's car drive past me. i don't know if it was his car. &amp;#x200b; interpretation: again, i'm pretty desperate to change my mindset, so i might be reading too much into these things... but here goes. the parking post was the first thing i saw. it seemed pretty intentionally removed from the ground (uprooted), rather than the result of an accident or a car knocking it over. (the other parking posts around it were intact.) i think i myself have been uprooted; i think it is meaningful that the post was not broken but rather cast aside. one of my fears is i am going through this divorce (cast aside by my husband) because i am intrinsically unloveable - that i am a broken human being. i also think it's meaningful that the uprooted post wasn't the result of an accident. this feels like a message of autonomy (my husband chose to be unfaithful, uprooting my life, and i have the autonomy to become unstuck). the orange parking cone (typically marking ""an area of a highway where road user conditions are changed"") feels like it means i'm at a point where i have to redirect; the conditions of my life have changed. the fact that it was set aside, next to a tree and serving no real purpose, feels like it means i can let go of caution/fear. the road is open. i combined the piece of trash and the license plate and looked up ""berco extremely cold"" on google. it directed me to [this page](https://www.thyssenkrupp-berco.com/rollers_1_en), which states: &gt;rollers by berco are designed and manufactured for long service life, resulting in low hourly operating costs. through-hardened or surface-hardened roll shell bodies increase wear resistance and ensure high structural strength and resistance to deformation. the seals guarantee permanent lubrification for optimum durability. rollers are typically engineered to keep things ""on track"". not sure if this is a reference to me being ""uprooted""/""off track"" due to this divorce, or if it's a sign that i am still ""on track"" or have a purpose. [through-hardening](https://www.paulo.com/services/heat-treating/through-hardening/) is the process of using a rapid quench to increase strength throughout an entire section of of steel. i wonder if this means i am going through a very rapid and difficult ""quenching"" (transformation) that will ultimately increase my strength. on the other hand, [surface-hardening](https://www.amarillogearservice.com/what-makes-case-hardening-and-surface-hardening-different/) is a process that increases the hardness of the metals surface while keeping the core soft. i've had fears of becoming bitter and jaded as a result of this divorce; i wonder if this means that i will still be to ""keep the core soft"". i think it's interesting that berco is a company associated with engineering, considering my educational background. i also think it's interesting that berco is associated with thyssenkrupp, a company i first learned about several years ago, while working on virtual, augmented, and mixed reality in a research &amp; development department. &amp;#x200b; what do you guys think? am i reading too much into this?"

should i stay or should i go? a 3 attractor chain and my first randonaut experience.,2019-09-04,"i discovered randonautting (did i verb that right?) last night when my cousin posted about it. i was immediately fascinated as i have become increasingly interested in quantum entanglement, parallel dimensions, etc. - i am pretty convinced of the simulation argument. since it was late at night though, i didn't go out. background: my partner of 8 years and i are currently separated as we both work on some issues (mostly mine tbh). we both love each other very much but as we approach 30 we are trying to decide whether we should continue together. as soon as i finished work today, i generated an attractor. it led me to a canadian tire (if you don't know, it's exactly what it sounds like - a canadian chain of auto body/hardware/home and garden stores). i got off the bus one stop early and headed. the point was right over the auto body shop. i got the sense that the message could be ""you have to fix the car before you can get back on the road."" as i turned around to examine if there were any signs or graffiti for a more specific message, i saw the train.... the go train (if you're not familiar with the toronto area these are our inter-city trains). the word go, just sitting there right in front of me. shit. my heart sank. but i continued to look around. behind the auto body shop were dumpsters and lots of trash strewn about in a fenced off area (so i couldn't clean it up). some graffiti on a shipping container informed me that ""(some guy's name) likes dildos up the butt. ooh baby."" (maybe a message to spice up our sex life? lol). as i was looking at this the go train pulled away. i decided to generate a new attractor. it led me to a house nearby. as i walked up the street i noticed there was construction on the water mains which was blocking half the street. i thought it might be blocking the sidewalk too but my path was clear. i got to the house. the exact point was back on the driveway, where there was also some junk and construction materials (didn't get a closer look, didn't want to be a creeper). on the front yard there was a little shrubby tree. it was perfectly round, trimmed that way i'm sure. the bottom half of the foliage was dead. only the very top was bright green. another mixed message. can it be saved? it doesn't look good, but i'm no shrub expert. i also noticed the house had snowflakes in the window. kind of odd considering it's early september. i generated another attractor from there and headed down the street. i thought the street ended in a dead end, and if i had been in a car, it would have been. but i was on foot, and there was a path. the third point was actually in a familiar spot, but one i hadn't passed in a long time. i used to babysit in the neighbourhood but they had moved away years ago. when i got to the attractor point, it was another house. actually, it was in between two houses. in the window of the one house, a hair further away from the point, were snowflakes. again, given the season, kind of odd. on the lawn closer to the point, there was a much lusher garden and one of those shrubby tree things (same or different species, i don't know). this one was trimmed into a cone shape pointing upwards. it was fully green and looked very healthy. something odd here was a very large rectangular rock that was sitting on 4 bricks, one at each corner. no clue if that's supposed to mean anything. at this point i decided to head back to the subway station and go home. i get it - it needs work. it will grow and change if the work is put in. i also have the option to go. and maybe a dildo up the butt every once in a while wouldn't hurt. if you see anything else in this trip, please let me know."
non-app based synchornicity (a.k.a. randonauts find each other at random),2019-09-04,"so.... i went to have my float today at zee float in my hometown in hamilton, ontario (which is where i've been posting all of y randonotes from). honestly, it was amazing. it actually healed my sore hamstring. i might actually be able to run again lol but i got to talking to james at the counter. he'd remarked on the book i'd picked up in the lounge post-float about lucid dreaming. after chatting a bit about that, i saw a connection between awareness of one's surroundings in order to trigger lucid dreams and randonauting, and i said ""i feel compelled to share this with you, but have you heard of the randonaut challenge?"" (or words to that effect). turns out that not only has james and his boss been out randonauting, but that both of the are right here on this very subreddit and have been posting things! and here's the kicker: i'd registered for this before i knew about randonauting, when they had a special on a first float. this is only day 3! day 3! (does it count if we didn't use telegram? )"

is there an alternative to telegram?,2019-09-05,"hi, i'm new here and kind of skeptical, but also kind of interested. i was wondering if there is an alternative (like a web interface) to the telegram bot or is telegram the only way to get the random coordinates? if not, are the telegram bots opensource and if so, where can the source code be found (is there a git or svn repo, etc.)?"
second trip report (power: 4.53): apocalyptic wasteland and animal intuition,2019-09-05,"background: for years, i have believed in this thing called ""the holy"". i grew up religious, catholic to be specific, but i never experienced god in the way that my peers did. i never felt his presence for myself, but i could see it in others. i saw it in resilience and in kindness. i became obsessed with books about human resilience, and i feel in love with characters that remained kind despite intense suffering. i think, in part, i wanted to see those characteristics in myself. in college, i took a yoga class in which the instructor taught me that the greeting ""namaste"" meant ""the holy in me greets the holy in you"". i had finally found a name for that seed of sacredness that i saw in so many human beings. it was also in college that i discovered i was bi/pansexual, as whoever i found ""the holy"" within, i tended to fall in love with, regardless of their gender, genitalia, or sexual orientation. i have never been able to see ""the holy"" in myself. although i no longer follow any religious beliefs, i still believe in god, but i have never felt his presence in my day-to-day life. for this trip, i set the intention as: to find the holy in myself. &amp;#x200b; results: the fatum bot assigned me this attractor point last night. around 6pm, i started preparing to leave, intending to make it home at around 8pm. while showering, i was besieged with such anxiety i started retching in the bathtub. i shook it off and leashed up my dog, intending to take her along, for protection, as an extended evening stroll. the sky was purple and spotted with clouds. upon exiting my front door, i was again besieged with intense anxiety and decided to stay home, making the excuse that i would wake up early and go in the morning. i looked up anxiety and randonauts at this point and discovered ""[the despair meme](https://www.reddit.com/r/randonauts/comments/bcqpvd/what_are_the_despair_and_void_memes/)"". i went to bed at 8pm, resolving to wake up early and try again before work. i ended up sleeping through my 4am alarm and did not wake up until 6am. at 6pm tonight, i tried again. i took my dog with me, bringing water for us both. i paid as much attention to the journey as i did to the intention of reaching my destination. i ended up taking a rather strange route, as i would alternate between following my dog where she wanted to go and allowing my gut instinct to guide me. it is important to note that during this time, i felt no anxiety or fear. i felt like i was on an adventure, with my best companion. at one point, i walked several blocks in the alleyways behind upper middle class suburban houses. it was strange to see the juxtaposition between manicured lawns and the trashed alleys only a few feet behind them. following these alleyways, i eventually came to an alley that ran parallel to the freeway. i was separated from this major highway by only a very tall beige brick wall. i had intense feelings of being somewhere forbidden at this point. it was a bit uncomfortable but mostly exciting. i could hear distant music emanating from a home far behind me, appearing to tempt me back to from whence i came, and yet i could also hear the roaring of cars on the motorway coming from the other side of the wall. if i followed the wall and continued down the alleyway, it would lead me to the attractor point. (it was here that i captured [these images](https://imgur.com/a/fihjmhq).) at this literal and metaphorical fork in the road, i saw: * strange storm clouds that appeared to reach down towards the ground, back from whence i came * a stone bench right between the alleyway that would lead me back towards home and the alleyway that would lead me onwards * a solitary traffic barricade, leaned up against the wall to the alleyway back towards home i decided to continue a bit father onwards along the wall, towards the attractor point. i then saw: * several broken bird scooters, with handlebars removed, appearing intentionally broken * what appeared to be an abandoned homeless person's camp hidden in the bushes (unphotographed) i became afraid (not just uncomfortable), for reasons that i cannot completely articulate. i headed out of the alleyway at this point, doubling back into suburbia, away from the attractor point. i could hear music but no voices. when i emerged, i found that i had been walking along a series of cul-de-sacs. the streets ended in a dead ends. i was walking behind the houses at the end of these dead-end streets. i continued onwards using a different route, stopping occasionally to rehydrate myself and the dog. when i was within 20 feet of the attractor point (when i could literally see the street on which the attractor point laid, from across a major four-lane road) my dog laid down on the grass in front of an apartment complex and refused to budge. her water bottle was empty at this point, so i gave her the rest of my water. she refused more water and rolled around on the grass. i sat down next to her and let her rest. for 20 minutes, she rested. i patted my legs, a gesture that usually causes her to sit between my legs and wait to be pet, but she did not come. completely out of character. i was spooked. this is the same dog that went with me on 8-10 mile hikes, bounding ahead of me on the trail before racing back minutes later to check on me. it was not exhaustion keeping her there. i let her rest some more, spending a total of almost a half hour about 20 feet away from the attractor point without ever reaching it. i called an uber and went home. because of the doubling back out of the alleyway and the stopping to rest, i did not get home until 8pm. &amp;#x200b; interpretation: the fork in the road holds the most significance to me. at the fork, i was greeted with the stone seat, a literal resting spot where i could've stopped to consider my choice but didn't. towards home, i saw strange storm clouds. in literature, storms tend to indicate [trauma](https://www.quora.com/what-do-storms-usually-symbolize-in-literary-fiction) or [madness](https://atkinsbookshelf.wordpress.com/2015/10/14/the-symbolism-of-storms-in-literature/). i have both in my past. the ""gateway"" to the alleyway that lead towards home was guarded by a traffic barricade that had been set aside. in my previous trip, i had also come across a similar traffic barricade (an orange cone) that appeared to be serving no purpose. for that trip, i had interpreted it to mean ""let go of caution/fear. the road is open."" does the fact that it was in the alleyway leading home hold significance? does this mean i should let go of my fear of my past? my trauma? my madness? before my last trip, i had expressed that i no longer wanted to be defined by my past. perhaps this was the final indication that it's time to let go. i had chosen not to follow that alley home but rather continue along the wall, where i came across broken, flightless ""birds"" and an abandoned home for someone without a real home. i feel like the symbolism is almost heavy handed at this point. all this time, i thought i was going somewhere but i was just hidden behind dead ends. i had persisted, and yet, i could not make it to the attractor point, despite how high its power level was. perhaps, i'm not ready... maybe i'm not ready to find the holy in me just yet. maybe i still have things in my past that i need to let go of. maybe now is the time to sit down, at an odd little resting spot, and find solace in the fact that i'm **here**, on the journey."

"set an intention of healing, got a void right in the middle of a hospital ",2019-09-06,i dont have anything acute that requires the attention of a hospital so i did not go. it was also pretty weak (below 2). i think the message was that healing was not what i needed to be asking for in that moment. this fits my subconscious understanding of the situation as well.
report 001 - visited three attractors,2019-09-06,"this was my first attempt to visit an attractor. i chained three attractors to make for a quick walk around town. my wife accompanied me. the first location was very sterile at first glance, but as we stood at the attractor and turned around, we noticed a small bit of graffiti on the wall. it appears to read ""wwii 1948 un"" and has a root or claw extending below ""un."" i'm not sure what this is trying to say.. https://i.redd.it/frpca04xlvk31.jpg as we approached the second attractor, we began to hear music apparently coming from the attractor point, which was strange because it was a warehouse and it was the labor day holiday. (music was the doors - hello, i love you) as we got closer we realized the music was reflecting off the warehouse from a house hidden behind a nearby line of trees, but it still added a surreal mood the the site. at the exact location of the attractor there was a sign reading ""like it never even happened."" https://i.redd.it/3ar3tlqwovk31.jpg the third attractor appeared to be in a vacant gravel lot. upon arrival we immediately noticed a bright yellow ball. it turned out to be a pool ball.. number 1. a fitting end to our first randonaut adventure. https://i.redd.it/z8i6dpasqvk31.jpg while i can't say there's anything happening to the state of our ""simulation"" during these trips, we really enjoyed the activity of taking a closer look at the world around us."

phone trouble story reader beware,2019-09-06,"yesterday was my 3rd randonaut expedition, i smoked some weed, and then went off on my way. walk was uneventful until i found someone's brand new iphone in the dirt, sort of leaning up against a tree beside the sidewalk, a few feet away from the attractor point. it was a dark red iphone, some dirt smudged on the screen but otherwise perfect condition, no case but no scratches. i figured it must have fallen out of somebody's pocket when they were climbing the tree, or maybe doing some gardening. i tried to turn it on but it was dead. i pocketed it so that i could charge it at home and try to figure out how to return it to its owner. i was kind of giddy about this random number generator leading me to someone's lost phone, and being able to return it to them, and tell them the story of how i found it. the only thing i was worried about was water damage, because i had no idea if this iphone was waterproof, there was a possibility that the sprinklers may have gotten to it before i did. i got home and plugged the phone in, but i wasn't sure which button was the power. i pressed random buttons and finally saw a battery icon on the display light up, looks like no liquid damage! i decided to just let the phone charge in peace and come back later to figure out how to get in touch with owner. i go to my room to tell my girlfriend about my find. a few minutes later i hear this terrible sound outside of my room! i run outside thinking maybe one of the neighbors burglar alarms went off, but the sound was coming from the mysterious iphone in the living room, which seemed to have turned on by itself. now i was still pretty high by this point, but i swear this sound was designed by some kind of mad scientist, it was the most distressing sound i've ever heard, it raised my hackles, i was sweating and panicking. there was a low ominous alarm sound, and then a very high pitched sound on top of it, terribly distressing! the screen was flashing and it showed a message that read **your location is being tracked by the authorities. return to apple store at once** i could see all the apps on the home screen, but their icons had the word cleaning over each one. i couldn't turn the alarm sound off, so i was just kinda scrambling around pressing every button on the thing trying to get this loud flashing thing to stop. it eventually lost charge after a couple of minutes and i could gather my half baked thoughts i figured that this must be part of some kind of iphone lost and found system that apple runs, where users can flag their phone as stolen through their apple account, and then it locks down the phone and accuses whoever has their phone of being a criminal and threatens them with gps tracking police in the hopes that they will return it to the apple store, apple will get in touch with the owner of the phone to come pick it up. i was resentful that apple was denying me the satisfaction of returning someones phone to them personally, and that they were blaring alarms and threats at me, treating me like im a criminal for trying to help. honestly i lost a lot of motivation to return the phone after that experience. i wanted to be a little hero, i didnt want to be a thwarted criminal! nonetheless, i decided it would be wrong to blame the phone's owner for this apple security policy. i did not want to turn the phone on again to look for contact information if i had to experience the alarm again, so the apple store was my only lead. i go to the apple store still rather high and i try to explain the situation to the employee who greets me. i'm sure he had no idea what i was talking about, but basically i was trying to go outside of my probability tunnel and i found this phone, the phone told me to bring it here, can the apple store get in contact with the owner of the phone and return it to them? i didnt want to give them the phone unless they were going to make an effort to return it. the guy told me that wasn't really something the apple store did, and why did i bring it here again? i was ready to just take it home with me again and try making a nextdoor posting for it, but i explained again about the phone screen, the alarm, the flashing, the threats, the message to bring it here. i could see something click on his face, and he told me that the store had been robbed a few nights ago, and that this wasnt anybody's phone, it belonged to the apple store, he thanked me for bringing it in, and i left somewhat disappointedly. i thought i was returning someone's irreplacable photos to them, i thought i was restoring someone's piece of mind, i wouldn't have gone to the trouble of picking the damn thing up if i had known i was only affecting .000001% of some multinational corporation's shrinkage markup anyway, im pretty sure apple has the gps location of my home and photos they had their iphone take of my panicked face somewhere in their loss prevention data archives. thanks for the interesting experience!"

how many of you believe in simulation theory? and why?,2019-09-16,"its a common misconception that the fatum bot was created in order to ""glitch the simulation"" or ""escape from the matrix"" what we are interested in, is the stasis field. basically a pattern or set of probabilities that keeps you locked in to a particular perceptual frame of reference. but the stasis field doesn't imply that reality is fake, or an imitation. its just a pattern, one that you can deviate from if you so choose. from the randonauts faq: [https://old.reddit.com/r/randonauts/wiki/faq](https://old.reddit.com/r/randonauts/wiki/faq) ### are you trying to break out of the matrix? using the matrix metaphor is an oversimplification of fatum theory. strictly speaking the nature of the experiment is not based in matrix/simulation theory, but we can't really say its not true, because it depends on how you define ""the matrix."" if you call the stasis field a matrix, it will be correct, that we are kind of hacking it. the stasis field is not some sort of fake reality, its just a pattern, that limits the available frame of observable reality to the sets of predetermined outcomes. fatum project is an attempt to expand that available frame of reality as much as possible by introducing randomness to holistic patterns. and intention-driven anomalies search via attractor points gives us an opportunity to exploit emergent fluctuations in randomness and their unique properties for the same goal. &amp;#x200b; **i'm interested in learning why you are interested in simulation theory, and how you think it relates to randonauts.** **do you believe in simulation theory? what do you define as a ""simulation?"" how does randonauts relate to that?**"

uke mapu symbol,2019-09-19,"ok heres the definition i found on wikipedia: the uke mapu ('mother earth' in english), for the mapuche people, ""is the earth in a deeper sense""; that is to say, it does not refer to the soil, the geological earth or to the planet earth, but it covers a broader concept. unlike pachamama, uke mapu ""is not considered a deity""; rather, it is considered as the representation of the ""mapuche world"" in the cosmography and the interaction of the mapuche people in it, within the mapuche religious beliefs. through the ngen (spirits of nature), and together with the chaw ant ('father sun'), she constantly gives life to that people. this fact implies the relationship of reciprocity that exists between the mapuche being and the earth. i didnt set any intention before going to the spot but i think it was a interesting thing to find and it kinda relates to all of this lol"

randonaut mindset on lodge 49,2019-09-19,"lodge 49 (amc) is a captivating show centered on a sort of masonic organization, called the lynxes, that maintains an alchemical mythology. the show cultivates a pynchonesque atmosphere (the central character's a down-and-out california surfer, the title is a nod to *the crying of lot 49*), and the story's incited by means of something like a randonaut experience: the surfer guy, dud, happens upon a lodge pin by chance, takes the artifact not knowing what it is, and iirc his car breaks down a bit later right in front of the lodge (a building he'd never noticed before), and that's his way in. unexpectedly dud turns out to be a spiritual adept, and in season 2 (going now) he apprentices himself to the lodge's alchemist. he's lately had a few visionary experiences, and isn't sure what to do with them, and the alchemist tells him this: &gt; everyone navigates the world using two maps: a physical map, cities and streets, but underneath, theres a mystical map, that shows the spots **where the world seems to let us in on the secret**. most people navigate using just the physical map, but alchemists move between the two: the daylight world, going to work, eating burritos, but then theres that other map, waiting down below. heard that and had to transcribe it: that notion of the ""other map"" fits so nicely into the randonaut experience, that personal cartography of voids and attractors that you start creating for yourself as you go where the bot takes you. as another of dud's mentors says in a later episode, ""the world is bound by secret knots."""

second trip -- a void predicting itself,2019-09-21,"second time out. decided to keep it within walking distance and (as a result?) this was every bit as much about the approach as about the spot itself. **void** (v-3219533, radius: 48m, power: 4.34, z-score: -4.19). no intention other than a general curiosity whether thered be some interaction between this experience and my first time outwhether the sense of entanglement, of a discourse somehow shaping itself, would carry over from the points-chaining exercise id done three days earlier. i had to cross train tracks to get to the neighborhood south of me where the void was located. i was just setting out, midway between my house and the crossing, thinking about the entanglement question, when i noticed a big evergreen on the other side of the street: the branches were full of these very large green berries, except not berries but more like brussels sprouts, and nothing id ever seen before on an evergreen. hanging thickly in clusters, like the disturbing apple tree that showed up at the void [where my first trip ended](https://reddit.com/r/randonauts/comments/cxyiu6/another_firsttimer_setting_out/). https://i.redd.it/ckpprigswyn31.jpg at virtually the same time i glanced down and saw a bike st. louis arrow on the street next to me, which looked not freshly painted but possibly recent, and which one way or the other id never remarked before. and a couple coming the opposite way up the sidewalk passed me, talking, and i heard the man say *and the really cool thing is on the third floor* as they went by. just that fragment. and somehow the conjunction of those three things, the tree, the bike sign, the cool thing on the third floori cant really explain it but there was this feeling of *significance* in the air, and immediately i wondered whether this was going to turn out somehow to be part of the void experience. (thats why i took the picture, which is turned against my direction of travel back towards the people who had just passed meiow i was going the way the bike arrow points.) within scarcely another half a block i saw a long freight train approach on the tracks ahead of me. (a train station, and a general theme of blocked access, featured in my first trip.) ive been walking past that crossing for two years now and its the first time ive ever had to stand there and wait for train cars to clear. that too had the feeling of an anomaly-before-the-anomaly. the void itself was smack in the middle of a t intersection between two quiet residential streets, with the stem of the t a single, steeply declining dead-end block. nothing going on. i fished around the four front yards giving directly on the intersection for a while, hoping for inspiration, and it wasnt until i went down the hill that i began seeing the pattern: * the **no outlet**theme obviously, being emphatically repeated from the prior trip; * but not just any no-outletthats a **train yard** in the distance of the second photo, blocking even visual access to the space beyond (in fact theres a double block, because the train yard itself is across a river from us); * and when i went down i saw the reason the street doesnt have an outlet, because theres a **bike greenway**that cuts it off from the road at the bottomone ive biked but never from this approach, which is kind of a back door to the path (places *in back of*being another void theme); and then walking up the hill i saw this partly stripped, diseased-looking **weird tree**in the front yard of one of the houses on the intersection (which i had somehow failed to register till now)a tree now not with too much but too little growing on it, at the same intersection-facing corner of its house as the odd evergreen from earlierand above me perched in a**third-floor** **dormer** of the same house a man in a bright red t-shirt removing or refitting a window. https://i.redd.it/i7fphkv2xyn31.jpg https://i.redd.it/jrqc8a92xyn31.jpg in other words, *every element* of that chill of significance i felt when i set out for the void was present at the site. the third-floor thing in particular felt very freaky. it was as if the void had somehow confirmed itself in advance, sent out a kind of temporal pre-echo at just the moment i raised the question for myself what or how i might want to investigate about it. part of me (the part that falls for cheesy puns) wishes i could say the guy in the dormer window was installing an air conditionerthus showing me an actual *really cool thing* on the third floorbut i dont know what he was doing, and it would have been weird yelling up at him to ask. (he was in the dormer just behind the tree but had disappeared from it by the time i took the picture.) in any case, im working on the sense that void points have to do with spaces of irony or critique or insufficiency: so maybe the point of the cool thing on the third floor is that its always going to be something beyond you, something unreachable."

nothing in a first-trip void,2019-09-22,"it's a sunny 30 degrees (86 f) as i set out with the intent to find an artifact. the void point is only 900 metres away. power: 2.03 z-score: -5.22 the city feels very alive as i walk down the street, the air hot and thick. all around i hear microphones and speakers in sunday worship, preaching, singing, echoing. people walk the streets in their sunday best. i see people dance and i see vendors selling aging fruit under their canopies or next to cars. one girl, maybe not yet a teen, picks her nose as she's been left to manage a stall full of fruit and vegetables; both her and the produce seem to be wilting in the heat. i cross a main road and then a bridge that crosses train tracks. this side of the tracks is cool and calm, the houses are large and beautiful and the air smells sweetly of many trees in bloom. i approach the point, just behind the front door of house number 190. above tall walls i can make out some stained-glass windows. i look around and see nothing of importance, wishfully thinking that there might be some forgotten jewelry on the ground. the papery bark of a tree scrapes in the breeze. across the road is a huge tree that's had a tunnel trimmed in the middle of it's crown to let telephone wires pass through safely. a family pulls up to their driveway and the young, handsome son gets out to lift a door that leads to a driveway. we make eye contact, he smiles and nods as he closes the door. i walk home feeling slightly dissapointed, slightly confused. back into the honking horns of the mini-bus taxis trying to call passengers. maybe the magic is in the expectation, in looking at the world as if it were going to speak. so then, it's difficult to understand when it decides to be quiet."

first outing with a funny find,2019-09-24,"new to this, my first walk last night. left the house and stopped to browse a pile of hard rubbish out on the street, which reminded me to set a location. my intention was just to see something, anything, significant. didn't have high expectations as the destination was in a suburban residential street. it started raining while i walked and a huge double rainbow appeared, as i crossed the road to the destination the sun hit my face and this was the view before and behind me. outside the house that was the destination there was a bag of junk sitting on the street, the only thing out in the whole street, there was this dragon foot 'chalice' on top. haha i was impressed. https://i.redd.it/z0jpp8qfxho31.jpg https://i.redd.it/h0jwjtpfxho31.jpg https://i.redd.it/v12je7qfxho31.jpg"
awesome results for a first time randonaut.,2019-09-24,"i discovered this subreddit yesterday quite accidentally. after having a (quite exhaustive!) read-through of how randonauting works, i was itching to start my first adventure as a randonaut. i used the fatum-bot and it took a few tries to get a good location. i live near a lake and it kept giving me points out in the middle of the water. once i had my location, i set off and tried to let the universe speak to me. honestly, i really didn't have anything in mind when i was doing this. i wasn't thinking of anything specific, no animals or items or anything like that. this whole notion of getting off your daily path was very exciting to me. i wanted to get to my random point and see what the universe had to offer. i drove to a very non-descript suburban new jersey road. there was a house at the exact location.... and that's about all. i waited for a few minutes and then decided i didn't want people to think i was some kind of creep, so i drove home. the street name held no meaning for me. the location wasn't anything special. i got home and started wishing i had checked the mailbox. maybe the person who owned the house had a familiar name or something. i searched the address online and found public records of who owned the house. the owner of the house had the same name as my dad. his middle name was the same name as my dad's brother (my uncle) and my uncle's son. his wife's name was the same as my wife's name, and also the same name as my first cousin. and yesterday i had been feeling down because it was the ninth anniversary of my dad's passing. at that time i had been spending a lot of time with his brother and my cousins. i definitely didn't think about any of that when i went on my journey today. i wasn't expecting anything, just staying open to whatever i might receive along the way. i was quite pleased with the results and can't wait to try it again!"
soliciting interview subjects,2019-09-24,"hi all, i'm currently develop a website, vitabrevis.online, that will focus on unique perspectives and ""fringe"" (for lack of a better word) concepts and communities. i've been fascinated by the randonaut community since i discovered it, and think that it is a ripe topic for an upcoming article. if anyone would like to possibly be an interview subject to provide some individual context to the discussion, please either pm or post below- i would rather not rip off top posts or experiences wholesale. all subjects will be cited and referenced. thanks, vb"
very strange experiences,2019-09-24,"i found this a week or two ago, and since then whenever i have a little bit of time to kill (i like to get out of the house, i work from home) this is such an interesting switch up from walks or bike rides around the neighbourhood. my first experience took me to a wooded area i've never explored before despite being very close to home, finding three trees in the middle of a clearing in a triangle shape. cool. i kept exploring, found some bones. probably just discarded bones a dog from the nearby apartment building had, but still, i was drawn to the trees, and two of them had bones, one at the base of the trunk, the other on the trunk itself, where the branches split up. intention was creative inspiration, and i got taken to a strange patch of trees in nature (life) with discarded bones (death). just standing at the trees stirred some inspiration, the bones really helped out... but then i went to my next attractor. which led me to a banner on a flagpole that read ""creativity is right here."" if i wasn't paying attention before / semi absently doing this, this felt like a wake up call. i had a few more interesting experiences being led to a lot of different mushroom iconography, statues of mushrooms in gardens, or mushrooms themselves growing at the base of trees. all aligned with creative inspiration at different attractors or voids. i decided creative inspiration was too vague and wanted something a little more solid as i kept going down the rabbit hole, and changed my intention to synchronicity. i was worried this would be too vague as well, but it spoke to me and i like finding meaning in things. so, i'm sitting there drinking a coffee speaking to fatum bot about nearby attractors while i was finishing a list of home renovation things i want to do, spurred on by a leak in one of my windows and a general frustration with old, shitty, windows. i don't make lists often, especially one like this with a whole list of long term things i want to get to, things that will make my old house look and feel new again. i finish up the list, plug in an attractor to my gps, and go on a bike ride following a chain of about 5-10 attractors and voids. i was feeling kind of bummed, thinking synchronicity would be a better ticket for ""proof"" if proof exists at all, as i can find inspiration in anything especially if i'm looking for it. but i'm just finding more mushrooms and the odd thing that feels like a stretch to give significance to, until... i get to a house, normal as any. look around, realize i've parked over a flyer that's been pasted to the ground with rain. i turn it over, and it's a handwritten canvassing poster for a window replacement company named renewal. whoa, okay. still feels like a bit of a coincidence though... until i look up at the basketball net over me -- drawn to the brand on the backboard: matrix. i took a photo of it, was about to go on my way, but to top off the experience the owner of the home arrived at that exact moment to catch a strange man finishing up my photo of his basketball hoop. he shouted at me... ""is there something wrong with the net?"" i said i was just exploring and hadn't seen the brand before and left, feeling very strange about it. i'd been on about 5 different sessions with fatum before this, and never had an interaction with someone at an attractor or void, especially not the exact homeowner of the place i was drawn to at the exact time they'd be coming home. all in all, i don't yet know what to make of any of this but it's giving me a way more interesting incentive to explore my. it's like pokemon go for trippy folks."

first time,2019-09-26,"so i just learned about this yesterday and i was immediately intrigued. i have been feeling super down lately about my job and the search to find something more meaningful and fulfilling career wise- so i tried to set my intention to find inspiration/motivation/a sign, literally anything. i got an attractor point and it took me to some kind of construction site so i was treading lightly with so many people around. i walked around the back to the exact location point and found myself in front of a big run down building. at first i didn't notice anything, and then i spotted a sign on the building with just the word ""chemistry"" in a font almost like this: ""chemistry"" i've been single for 4 years now and have been fine with that but lately i've found myself wanting a relationship and love (which is weird for me). anyways, i met this guy last week and we've been on a couple dates and even went hiking yesterday. i'm starting to feel like it's some sort of sign that i should be open to allowing him into my life and not push everyone away that i meet. on top of that, i sort of took away from the construction site location that i need to work harder at trying to achieve my career goals instead of just talking about it. when i turned around to leave a beautiful butterfly flew around me for a couple seconds and then flew away. it was a surreal moment and made me feel validated in this experience. (side note; im curious if anyone else has seen butterflies during their experiences?) i'm looking forward to trying this again! whether it's all coincidence or there is actually something more, it's a good way to find meaning in things and to take a deeper look within. i'd love to hear yalls thoughts!"

"thought first trip was a dud, maybe not. outsiders perspective?",2019-09-27,"found out about all this randonaut stuff yesterday. shout out jessa reed &lt;3 , i love aaron and you. i looked up my first attractor point yesterday at work, was a cemetery 30 mins from my place in brooklyn, but i was working all night. next day: i set my intention: am i on my best/true/happy fulfilling path in life, like i think i am, right now? -i recently decided to save to leave nyc after 5 yrs, within a couple of years, get land, buy a yurt, lots of change, creativity, woowoo stuff...freedom bla bla i get new attractor point within walking distance because i have a massage to make and it's supposed to rain. 30 min walk. anyway, i just get the coordinates and go. i get there and the exact location looks like it's in the brooklyn navy yard? the closest i can get from the sidewalk at this time is photos #1-3, the gate. i see the pretty gate and graffiti face and think, ""cool i can't get in"". i have to leave to make my appt and it starts raining hard. the corner of the block is basically covered by this huge stone wall or overgrown fence. i didn't have time to search around the corner. last thing i see as i'm leaving, on the corner of the block it says bldg 311. i love those numbers but who doesn't? the numbers i use frequently are 1337, moms is 3737, and dads is 1393. also see 11:11 almost every day. i think 11 is my numerology number as well. i go on my walk to my massage and home and take the rest of the unnumbered (attached) photos. later i look up the attractor point on google street view to see if i can get a better view and see it's another cemetery! and a gorgeous [park. pics](https://park.pics) 4,5,6 thoughts?"
1st try thursdays,2019-09-27,"today i tried this for the first time. i had never heard of any of this before until yesterday. i had been having really strong and noticeable synchronicities the last couple of days and then i heard about this randomly on twitter and was instantly intrigued. i went out on my bike for about and hour and a half. i did three attractors and one quantum and didnt really notice anything jumping out at me. it did lead me to some parts of my city i hadnt been to before. all but one location being abandoned, quiet places. even though i didnt have anything crazy happen i did have an overwhelming sense of peace at some of these places, it being quiet and all. i will definitely continue going out after work and stuff."

intention: affection &gt; house of someone i cared for who had passed away that week,2019-10-01,"i wanted to experiment with the new /getida command, so i tried out a few strong emotions, e.g. revenge, forgiveness, and affection. i live in a country town, so up until this point all of my /getquantum /getattractor etc results had just put me in a field of some sort. when i concentrated on the feeling of ""affection"" then to my surprise for the first time i got a result in front of a house. i couldn't shake the feeling that i had been to the address before. i was astonished and genuinely touched when i realised that it was the house of a lovely lady who had died the week before, and who had been on my mind that whole week. it felt as though it was a personal message to say that she was okay. she was a lovely, strong woman who never complained no matter how heavy her burdens. i had seen her so close to death, yet despite extreme frailty she still found the strength to claw herself back into life and get out of hospital after months. sadly she slipped two days later in respite care, and died quietly in her sleep that night. a lady who was loved by everyone she met, and a beautiful result of the intention driven anomaly."
second trip: scary,2019-10-01,"so my best friend, roommate, and soul sister emily and i did our first trip together and didn't set any intentions but were taken to a really rich neighborhood filled with mansions. on our second trip, we were also taken to a wealthy neighborhood. this time we did set intentions of ""love"" however this is not what we found. this time the pin was located on the only house in the neighborhood decorated for halloween. but these were not cute and fun halloween decorations, they were pretty intense if you ask me (a lot of hanging dolls and possessed looking creatures) anyways, we went home and then this is where the real scary stuff goes down. i woke up at 4:30am with sleep paralysis (which im very familiar with because for one summer a few years ago i had it 3/4 times a week) and i normally am not scared during it anymore but this time i felt very dark energy. i woke myself out of it by moving my fingers (a trick i learned that summer) i prayed for protection from the universe/god and gave myself a pep talk about not being afraid and went back to sleep. i ""woke"" up again at 6:30 in sleep paralysis and this time i was lying on my side facing the wall where my white pillows should be but instead i saw a black square like a tv screen but i knew there wasn't a tv there so i woke myself out of it again and went to emily's room. i woke her up and told her i was scared because i had sleep paralysis and she said ""me too"" so i said ""when"" and she said ""tonight"". so then i laid down and as i was trying to fall asleep i was hearing a lot of high-frequency tones at different pitches, almost like if high-frequency tones were in a windchime. all in all, it was scary and we both independently came to the conclusion that it had something to do with our little trip. any thoughts?"
is it bad to skip a lot of attractor points?,2019-10-01,"i live in rural tennessee, and most of the points i get are on farms or fenced property that if i were to walk into, i might meet face to face with an angry farmer and a shotgun (has happened before). these are what most of my void and attractor points wind up regardless of my intention. so is it bad to keep getting attractor points over and over again in one sitting until i find one thats at least attainable?"

first experience: door to nowhere and a grave with my name (almost),2019-10-05,"i finally got around to trying this out. i've been meaning to do so for weeks now, ever since i found out about it. it's right up my alley, so to speak. i set my intention for ""something magical"". i've been feeling a bit adrift lately, and feeling like the color has gone out of the world, so i wanted something to remind me that anything can happen. i set a /getvoid and walked to a location where i would never end up otherwise: a small street with an interstate entry way on one side, flanked by a large noise-blocking wall. at first i didn't see anything, but then, just ten or so feet away from the pinpoint, i noticed a [door] (https://imgur.com/a/w3nzrty) in the noise-blocking wall, about three feet off the ground. presumably it's an emergency door for entrance and exit to the interstate. a bit magical, i suppose. i would have tried the door, but a police car drove by right as i was walking by the spot. i set a /getattractor from that point. i didn't form an intention in the moment, but during my walk to the void i had formed an intention to find something related to a big case i've been working on for years and for which the resolution always seems just out of reach. i wanted to see something to remind of the case or, for some real magic, to point me to a resolution. the attractor took me to a graveyard in town. i'm a lifetime lover of graveyards, but i haven't had a chance to explore this one yet since moving to town. all the way up the hill, over the ridge, and left to a small knoll of trees and old gravestones. it was a beautiful spot, with the sun just cresting the western horizon and crepuscular rays scintillating through the tree branches. i read some of the stones and didn't notice anything in particular, although there was one large stone with a pillar that had toppled over, seemingly somewhat recently. then, as i was walking away, i saw a stone with the name of one of the witnesses from my case. it's a fairly common name, i suppose, but it did get my attention. i walked on a looked to the left. there, another stone with the last name of another witness in the case--this name more unusual. something? perhaps. had it been one of the truly unusual names in my case--and there are plenty--*that* would have struck me cold. walking back to my truck, i noticed a large grave with a tower to my right. the name was the same as mine but with a different last letter. same pronunciation. someone in town had told me a few weeks ago that there was a famous family in town that shared my last name. looks like i found them. all in all, a good first time out. it's impossible to parse confirmation bias from magic, and i never felt any real sense of wonder. but i'm left wondering what it all means all the same."

random... and mundane... i think that's the point.,2019-10-11,"&amp;#x200b; so, i've been playing with fatum for a while... i've seen ""what the bleep"" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g3-zc9mtm&amp;t=9052s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6g3-zc9mtm&amp;t=9052s) ... and have had some very weird experiences lately (when i say lately, i mean constantly for 3 months at a very noticeable frequency.. i've been alive for almost 40 years and have never seen the matrix go ape-shit like this:) )... i've experimented with quantum intention and i have some other stories to share... but i think i need to share this one to start... just, because its so mundane and random... hopefully i have more after this :) i am trying to lose weight from being in a very wrong place for a while... so i have a dedicated weight/lifting walking routine that i've worked out myself (based on my past). today, i decided was a walking day... and every ""walking day"" i walk fast about 5 km's (there and back) along my home beach-front. i got to the middle-point of the walk, and decided i was going to generate an anomaly (/getanomaly). i was standing on a pier, so that could've messed with it... but the coordinates were generated to the west of me in the ocean; just off the beach-front close to a place i used to live (as it usually is... everywhere that's difficult to get to). so, i walk along the beach-front just burning some kjs (sorry poms)... and randomly there's a girl that wants to dump buckets of sea-sand... onto the beach.... of sea-sand. (this was clearly not on top of the anomaly... but 100% north from land - remember, the anomaly was south and i had no way to traverse the ocean at the time) i could've been more suave (but let's face it, i'm too old)... at the time i didn't take any notice; i was just helping out a girl doing her thing... however... (what made me post this...)... i was helping a girl dump buckets of sea-sand (that she couldn't lift) onto a beach... of sea-sand... did any of you guys do this yesterday?"

why go to attractors instead of a purely random coordinate generated straight from the qrngs?,2019-10-13,"if the objective of the people in this sub is to break the predetermination by going to a quantumly randomized places, why are we going to the attractors instead of purely random places? according to [this paper](http://noosphere.princeton.edu/papers/pear/fieldreg2.pdf) i found on this sub's wiki, there's a possibility that consciousness affects qrngs. doesn't that mean by going to the attractors generated by a qrng, we are going to places where we should be because consciousness ""wants"" us to be there? isn't this the opposite of breaking the predetermination?"

first experience.,2019-10-14,"i used getattractor and set my intention in abundance. received a point 1 kilometer away from home. went there with my husband and there was nothing particular or that called our attention. it was a property belonging to a governmental institution that generates electricity (ice). the area was full of trees and then next to it was some sort of artificial canyon that we supposed was por avoiding fires in dry season. there was an add for the sale of hay with an arrow in it that by chance was pointing to that place. that was all. back home, our remote for the garage door wasnt working, which was kind of peculiar since it was new. couple of hours later, it was working properly. what called my attention was that i try to get another point to visit after the first one by using getpoint, getvoid, getquantum. this happened almost immediately after the first experience, since it took us like 5 minutes to go to the first place and we were excited to see what places could we go next. the thing is, we received almost the exact same point every time. was that because trying to get a point immediately after the first experience? besides, the location we keep getting was a location between 500 and 200 meters in the property next to ours following our backyard. that property is land for pastures and is not currently in use. we even drive 10 kilometers to the next small town (we live in rural area) and keep getting the same points every time. we didnt go to the point because is rainy season and it was pouring."
first experience: diamond eyes and musgo?,2019-10-15,"i go to open the app and /getattractor for my first voyage and my phone dies. i get in the car and plug it in. it boots up, i pick it up, it crashes. weird. so i let it sit charging. it turns on, i pick it up, it dies. this never happens. this happens about 6x and i decide fuck it. im driving home. so i begin the drive home, eyeing my charging phone. still dead. i say to myself i can be random on my own and i take an immediate right down a road ive never taken on my way home. my phone immediately turns on. i pull over and enter /getattractor and it gives me a spot nearby; i begin my drive. i set my intention show me something cool. purposely vague. i decide to turn on the radio and that the first song that plays will be a sign. i am not disappointed. its diamond eyes by deftones and the cover art is an owl i arrive at my destination, a cookie cutter neighborhood behind an elementary school. the hotspot is right where a car is parked with a custom license plate that reads musgo. musgo? i dont see anything else of interest so i figure i must go i get home and google musgo its portuguese for moss, its also a famous luxury mens cologne thats been around since 1930, made in portugal. my wife and i had been talking the day prior about visiting portugal so theres that slight synchronicity? regardless, im intrigued."

randonauts augmented reality game: adventures in synchromysticism,2019-10-21,"all belief systems, whether theyre a religion, philosophy, or science based world view, are just stories we tell ourselves about the world we live in. these stories then dictate the way we perceive the world. its not what you look at that matters, its what you see. henry david thoreau however, none of the stories we tell ourselves are totally true. religions change with each new revelation, philosophies die out or evolve, and scientific models are constantly being updated and rewritten. the truth is, there is no ultimate truth we can use to understand the universe. any truth you subscribe is nothing more than someone elses perception. there is no truth. there is only perception. gustave flaubert religions are someone elses mystical musings, philosophies are someone elses deep contemplations, and science is someone elses theoretical framework. you may not realize it, but realities are constantly being manufactured for us. the news tells you what the world is like and the commercials tell you what you like. today we live in a society in which spurious realities are manufactured by the media, by governments, by big corporations, by religious groups, political groups. so i ask in my writing, what is real? philip k. dick what we call reality is a fabrication, and its made up of other peoples perceptions. people just like you and me. yet, its so much easier for us to entertain other peoples ideas. yet its clear to me that its those who think for themselves, who write their own story, who live the most meaningful lives. i believe that imagination is stronger than knowledge. that myth is more potent than history. that dreams are more powerful than facts. that hope always triumphs over experience. that laughter is the only cure for grief. and i believe that love is stronger than death. robert fulghum i believe narratives create reality. so i say we start writing our own. i truly believe by forming a group whos using the fatum technology with a focused intention, we can create a doorway into a new, better dimension. we will find this dimension by using the bots access to the quantum realm. we will travel the multiverse in search of the fabled stargate that takes us there. we will know we are getting close when we start finding magick artifacts and energy vortexes. these vortexes usually show up in the form of synchronicities. we must follow them like guideposts. ill post more details later, but for now, ill leave it at that. so anyways, who wants to *play*?"
first few times to try,2019-10-21,"my very first try at this took me to a nearby baptist church. i know the location well, i pass by it almost daily but don't pay it much attention. the two things that stood out was the church sign that had the following scripture, ""children are a gift from the lord; they are a reward from him. ' psalm 127:3 and as they are also doing construction by the road there was a long line of drainage pipes stamped with the name forterra, with means ""for the earth."" the second location was actually in the bay (in the water) so i drove to the street that dead ends directly in front of the location. did not notice much except for birds. more birds than i usually see in the trees, flying in flocks, and many brown pelicans diving into the water going for food. my last trip for the day took me into a nearby neighborhood to an area unfamiliar to me. there was a lady out cleaning storage containers in her driveway at the exact location. kinda interesting since no one else in the entire neighborhood was out. she noticed me drive by slowly and as i came around for a second look she stayed looking at me so i stopped and asked if the house was on the market? she said no, but was very friendly and after a short exchange saying i must have gotten the wrong address yada yada, got a friendly wave good bye. i wasn't sure what to expect with these outings will definitely being doing this again. i've been thinking about the scripture, birds and the friendly lady all afternoon....."

first time randonauting,2019-10-24,"so a few weeks ago i decided to try this out for the first time. my boyfriend is a real sceptical who likes to tease me with all the ""weird stuff"" i follow up on (glitch in the matrix, multiversetheory, simulation theory, missing 411, and now randonauting). so obviously he didn't want to come along on my first trip. he wanted to stay home and make fun of me (i don't mind him making fun of me, i make fun of him too, for closing himself off from all the wonders of ""the universe"", as i call it). i generated a point with the ""getattractor"" command (still don't really know the difference between the different kind of generatable points/voids/anomaly/attractor). it said it was an intention driven anomaly, type attractor, power 2.65 and z-score 3.56 (also no idea what the ""z-score"" and the ""intention driven anomaly"" means). while generating it, i didn't think of anything in particular, i just wanted to be open to whatever the universe had to tell me. the generated point was kind of close to my home, i pass there about once a month on a run or walk with the dog. boyfriend's reaction was: ""hah, there's nothing there, we know that trail, you're not gonna find anything there"". and honestly, i thought the same thing since there truly isn't anything there, it's a small road / trail with open fields on both sides. no weird houses or hidden trails or anything nearby. but i decided to check it out anyway. on my way there i passed a man who was picking up garbage. ""weird"", i thought. i usually never meet anyone when i go for a walk or a run in that area. i thought about one of the tips i read on here ""bring a trash bag and pick up trash from the point you visit"" and wondered if the guy was randonauting too. unfortunately, i was too socially awkward to ask him about it. i continued my walk to the point. at about 80 meters away from the point, i noticed [this](https://imgur.com/a/gqdhstb). there was definitely something big there, at more or less the generated point!! when i got there, i saw that it was a full garbage bag. in my country we have a program run by volunteers to pick up trash and when you're bag is full, you can leave it there and the municipality will pick it up to process. so that's definitely what that man i saw had been doing, and a [full trash bag](https://imgur.com/a/sarenjj) just happened to be left at 4 meters from my generated point. the weird thing is, i had been thinking about signing up as a volunteer in said program for a few months, just never got around to actually doing so. my generated point was 4 meters to the right, in the nearby field. i went in to check it, but didn't find anything but mud and crops. if there was anything there, it probably got picked up by the trash-collector. &amp;#x200b; i don't believe in coincidences, so i am 200% sure that what the universe was trying to tell me, was to sign up as a volunteer to pick up trash too. so obviously, a few days later i signed up. am currently waiting for the special white trash bags to arrive and will definitely do more randonauting while actually picking up trash. oh and one other funny thing: my boyfriend couldn't believe it when i told him. he's been more open to listening to ""the universe"" since then. and he was stunned i didn't open the bag to take a look inside, he said ""who knows what you could've found in there!!"" lol. i didn't need to look inside the bag, i already knew what the universe wanted to tell me and have acted on it since. &amp;#x200b; regards, posi."

first time randonauting and the bot is obsessed with london,2019-10-25,"tried out the fatum-bot for the first time today and went on a nice walk in the woods and ended up in a beautiful spot in the woods. close to the pin the compass was acting up (happens every now and then on my phone tbh) so it took some time going in circles before i was happy that i found the spot. actually found a decent amount of chantarelles and a tiny tiny amanita mushroom which i might take a walk back to pick once it has grown up in a week or so. the amanita is supposed to be a nice way to heighten your consciousness and is not lethal if it has dried properly. all in all a nice walk and a funny mystic and adventurous feeling engulfed me as i was getting closer to the pin. my main reason im writing here is because i was playing around with the bot with a radius of 100000 m since i feel like travelling (i live in sweden). and 5 out of 5 /getquantum has put the pin in london now (first one in the sea just outside london and the other 4 in the very city center. ive been to london a few times and im not the biggest fan of the city or huge cities in general really. but the pin just wont drop anywhere else :d i will keep trying just for the fun of it but seems like its all about london for the bot. maybe i just have to go... anyway, a lot of fun to have tried out randonauting and there will definitely be more quantum directed walks to come! also nice to have found this community and getting inspiration from all of you open minded people!"
1st randonauting experience - interesting and unexpected results!,2019-10-25,"i tried my first randonaut journey the other day. it was in my lunchtime at work so i only set a 1000m radius. i asked for an attractor point with the intention of learning something about the nature of reality. i got a power of 2.69 and z-score of 3.81. as i set off i got stuck behind a group of slow walking foreign students who were filling the pavement. i got a bit annoyed as i didn't have much time to complete the journey and due to traffic i couldn't overtake. every turn i was due to make they turned in front of me frustrating me more until we came to a language school where they went in. relieved, i walked past the school where some students and teachers were smoking in the garden outside. as i went past i recognised one of the people i saw but couldn't immediately place them. i carried on walking and a few moments later it came to me that the person i saw was someone i had met on a random night out a few years earlier and become fb friends at the time with but never met up with again since. i probably should have turned back to go and have a chat but didn't as was conscious of my limited time. i continued towards the attractor point. i suddenly became aware of the sound of my footsteps. i was wearing soft soled trainers so not making much noise but what i could hear sounded strangely hollow. nothing more to note on that but thought it's worth a mention! i then passed a telecommunications box and noticed some graffiti on the top that said 'know thyself!'. interesting! &amp;#x200b; https://i.redd.it/20vs9wj4equ31.jpg i then continued to the attractor point. looking at the map, the point was located inside of a private residence which was a bit frustrating. it is quite an affluent well-to-do neighbourhood so i felt a bit conspicuous and uncomfortable hanging around looking for signs! there was nothing much of note except some strange looking vents on the other side of the road that i'd not seen similar before. also a sign on the wall that said 'flood risk, please do not park on the drain'. &amp;#x200b; &amp;#x200b; https://i.redd.it/irnpjfbdequ31.jpg &amp;#x200b; https://i.redd.it/uxe6n6peequ31.jpg &amp;#x200b; i walked up the road and back again but saw nothing else that drew my attention. i still had a bit of time before i had to be back at work so i decided to try another attractor point in the hope it would be somewhere nearby. this one had a power of 2.03 and a z-score of 4.01. i looked at the map on telegram and had a shock when i realised that the point was located on the road where my boss from a former job lives. sadly it was too far to be able to make it there and back to work in time so i had to forego discovering what i would find and head back to work (i must admit i was also a bit daunted by the idea of being seen by my ex boss hanging out on their road!) even though i didn't make it there, the location of this attractor point definitely gave me a weird feeling as seemed too much of a coincidence from all the roads in a 1km radius in the middle of a city, it was leading me to one where i knew one of the inhabitants! the strangest part of the whole story is when i got home and compared the point on the telegram map to my ex bosses exact address. the point was directly outside their house! so, not exactly what i was expecting from the whole experience but definitely interesting results and i'll be sure to give it another go but next time making sure i have much more time on my hands."

the street's name translates to ""speech"" &amp;#x200b; [the exact point was behind this door. it's right next to an elementary school if that matters.](https://i.redd.it/66dgc735qqu31.jpg) i increased the radius to 4000, got another point but i realized that's too far and the power was only 1.84, fuck that. reduced it back to 3000 and this time i decided to use getida rather than getattractor \#4: void;1.88 on the map it said the street's name was ""paradise"", at least that's what it translates to. so i got a taxi, he dropped me off before we got there because the street was in a pretty shitty location. i got off and as i was walking there, i thought to myself ""man when am i gonna get to see some piss bottles?"". when i got there i looked at the street name and it was different from the map, it was ""helen"" rather than paradise. i didn't see anything special, just some empty land, an ambulance at the corner, and some trash and feathers. didn't see any particularly interesting trash, just a pack of philip morris cigarettes that i thought were cool cuz i'd never seen them before. the exact location was between two cars but i'm not sure cuz my gps keep going crazy. looked at the plates, one had 111 and the other was normal. i decided to take a picture of the normal one too and as soon as i took my picture i saw a half full bottle with a yellow liquid inside of it. now i ain't sayin' it's piss, but i've never seen any other yellow liquid with this shade. &amp;#x200b; https://i.redd.it/jj468czxsqu31.jpg &amp;#x200b; [111 but it's not special cuz the last two digits are always repeated in my city. so every car is like 11,22,33 etc.](https://i.redd.it/ptshvrwysqu31.jpg) &amp;#x200b; https://i.redd.it/ybq2vzx4tqu31.jpg i'm gonna be honest with you, still not convinced. i was, however, very exhausted. i decided my next point will be near my house so i set my location in that general area, sent getida, and got a taxi to the location. \#5: attractor; 1.89 by the time i got there the sun had already set. the location was smack dab in the middle of a residential building so i knew i couldn't reach the exact location. that didn't stop me from looking around though. decided to look at car plates, starting with the one right next to the building. &amp;#x200b; [boom! 666. yea i know you probably can't read these numerals but it's 666. you might also realize that i didn't censor the first 2 numbers and the letter, that's because...](https://i.redd.it/8e1fromxuqu31.jpg) &amp;#x200b; [boom! car right in front of the previous one had the same two digit number and letter and 444. but guess what?](https://i.redd.it/h0r06xi5vqu31.jpg) &amp;#x200b; [more 666 across the street](https://i.redd.it/g8fmswrbvqu31.jpg) that was about it for this point. i then started to walk, well actually, trek home. on the way i was thinking about how those numbers aren't really special i mean the last two are always repeated here so getting that one 6 or 4 isn't really special. i decided to look at the plates i see on the way home to confirm that indeed they are very common. while i was doing that i saw 3 cars with 666 just the two above, so i guess they are common? nope, they're not, i'll say why in a bit. when i got home i was extremely tired. i've had days where i was out for more than 12 hours but i didn't feel this exhausted even then. it's weird cuz i was only out for 3 hours (despair meme?). i fought the sleepiness and exhaustion and went out with my friend. while i was out i still tried to confirm that these plates where common. i remembered to check 3 times while i was out and in every one of those times the first car i saw had 666 in the same order as the previous umm 5. 666 count: 8 originally our plan was to go out and eat but instead we went to a park that we frequently go to. while we were talking, i noticed huge owl graffiti on a wall that i've passed by a billion times. that was the first time i'd seen that owl and i just thought it was kinda cool that i saw it on my first day randonauting. i'll take a picture tomorrow and post it here if i can. finally, as he was dropping me off, i looked at the odometer and saw something cool &amp;#x200b; https://i.redd.it/f6d15z4uxqu31.jpg oh and here's why i think the repetition of these car plates is at least slightly significant. i tried my best to focus on car plates this whole week and i saw maybe 2-3 cars with numbers repeated in the same way as the ones i found on saturday. i saw at least 10 (there were more i didn't mention) in one day, 8 of which were 666. maybe i'm trying too hard to make it meaningful, idk. oh and i tried to type this the same night (saturday) but my laptop blue screened as soon as i started to type. this happens every now and then so meh. tl;dr 4 attractors, 1 void found my initials l.a written on a wall (my shirt had l.a written on it) one large bottle filled with a yellow liquid that may or may not be piss at least 10 care plates with 3 repeated digits throughout the day, now that's not special because of the format of car plates here but at least 8 of the 10 were 666 extreme exhaustion, owl graffiti and more repetitive numbers after the trips"

first time doing a chain trip + first post + test-driving the new facebook bot in the field,2019-10-26,"after a couple of months in development and never having been on a chain trip so far i was eager do both in the field today. i snuck away for a couple of hours saturday morning after i dropped my son off at soccer practice and then headed out on my semi-electric assisted bike. first up was just a single quantum point (radius at 1345m left over from previous testing, and starting point the soccer grounds) taking me up the hill behind my house upon which there is a pretty big shinto shrine on the top (which i've been to many times before). the point was just down the street a little bit before the shrine's main carpark. before departing i noticed the google map thumbnail also said there was a buddhist temple right beside it which i didn't know about. those are the two major religions here in japan, co-existing pretty peacefully with bits from both being merged into a lot of the daily life and culture here. once i got to the area i immediately found this awesome lookout tower with a 360 degree view of my whole area. this was a nice discovery despite having driven/walked past a number of times in the past few years when heading to the shrine for a visit and having never noticed it. right on the actual spot was a piece of rubbish (first randotrash! :d) and a perfect first take-home artifact, some pig-nose looking bit of wood. later my son said it was probably the remnants of some pig the shinto gods had eaten. it was the side of the road, peering down a very steep part of the hill into a forest. *processing img twk1z0rrctu31...* *processing img gyp6r2rrctu31...* *processing img rmcxnwsrctu31...* deciding to move onto the next point, i use the new ""intent suggestions"" feature to quantum-randomly get some suggestions from the dictionary. mine were: mutular, burse, seshat, fastuously, carrions didn't know what carrions meant, so looked it up and found it meant ""the decaying flesh of dead animals"". nice. so i reluctantly set my intention to carrions while starting to imagine i'm going to find some dead animal's body. set radius to 3333m (as i've been enjoying myself noticing a lot of 33s recently) and low-and-behold, the attractor is a place smack bang in the middle of a forest - the ideal place no-doubt for my intention to be realized (thankfully it wasn't). the forest is one i've never stopped and gone inside but driven past lots of times. radius: 69m power: 3.72 z-score: 4.17 at first things look welcoming. *processing img i2g0beb0itu31...* the actual the point was in a much denser part. initially i started to wonder if i really want to go into underbrush that thick but considering both points so far had been forests and generally i get water or urban areas, my curiosity drove me forward and i'm glad it did. *processing img yftipmn7itu31...* as i ventured in further my gps point on google maps kept dancing all over the show from in the forest to out of it. it took a bit of finding the best path through all the bushes but as i got really close to the point i found the ""random"" part of the whole trip. *processing img 0jlfh3xdjtu31...* it was pretty close to the point and i just started laughing. i'm not going to bother try and infer any special meaning out of it (although i did love peter rabbit when i was young). just the random discovery in itself, considering the only other manmade objects i found were some beer cans and broken plastic crates near the edge of the forest. figuring it's time to start heading back, i set the location back to the soccer ground and set a radius of 1001m. tried a mystery point hoping it would be somewhere kind of on the way back so i could achieve my goal of a 3-point chain today. found my first bug for the day; the new ""skip water points"" feature. one of the types of mystery points was getting itself stuck in a loop and thinking every point was water and gave up with ""couldn't find anything but void water points. try again later."" (i've set it to give up after 10). tried again and got a point generated on the same street where i'd been at the first point. it's a windy road that goes up the hill. this third point was down the bottom of the street, also in a forest above a step bank. https://i.redd.it/kfwor8keltu31.png nothing much of interest here and not enough time to climb up as soccer practice was almost up so that ended the chain trip for the day. i was telling my son about it while we ate indian for lunch although he was more interested in having me look up on google where we could find pokemon go gyms where mewtoo could be caught. i got him to try generating an attractor with the intention of find a mewtoo gym. we got radius: 29m power: 4.19 z-score: 4.14 but it just turned out to be a carpark with no gyms in the area. no luck there!"

power level and z-score,2019-10-26,"so i ran across the fatum project out of pure randomness and decided the explore it out of curiosity. i was bored yesterday and explored four different anomalies according to the fatum bot. i may post my experience later but for right now i have a couple of questions. after researching power level, i'm still confused as to what it means. so that's my first question. can someone better explain what a power level is? i couldn't find anything on z-score. so, what's a z-score? for reference on the four locations i visited. 1st location: power level - 2.16 z score - 4.38 2nd location: power level - 2.01 z score - 3.63 3rd location: power level - 0.67 z score - (-)3.51(negative) 4th location: power level 2.70 z score - 4.22"
how do i set an intention?,2019-10-27,title says it all
fatum bot looks out for me,2019-10-27,"the same restlessness i'd been feeling for days was happening when i set an attractor intention for ""what is the best thing i can do for self care right now?"". fatum bot sent me to a house in the student neighborhood around my alma mater (i moved back to the same city two years ago, and live nearby). took a while to find street parking, but one opened up right in front of me near the attractor point. the house itself was unremarkable to me, and i chalked it up to a failure, so i decided to run an errand while in the neighbourhood. on my way back to my car, i see an old friend of mine walking up to my intersection. seems he has decided to get a quick dinner while waiting for a contractor to arrive. he's the owner of our old fraternity's chapter house and has been doing some upgrades. we chatted over shawarma and then he invited me back to see what he'd done. at the house, i caught up with some of the younger members and we had fun talking cooking, tv shows, philosophy, politics. the house also looked amazing. none of this was planned. i had no idea i'd be doing any of this when i got in my car that day. heading home after an hour or so, i realized i'd been isolated for the last few weeks and hadn't spent time with my friends just hanging out and chatting as we did. if i hadn't gone to that apparently useless attractor point, i wouldn't have had that time. the attractor point was just the starting point. it knew what i needed. strong power, too, compared to my usuals: 3.21"

found spiderman on my second randonauting adventure,2019-10-27,"on my first visit to an attractor point, i set an intention for 'enlightenment'. the attractor was inside a large fenced-in rock &amp; aggregate site. i got as close as i could and found myself near a field of solar panels at sunset. en\*light\*ening indeed! today's attractor point was set with the intention 'help/helping'. en route to the attractor, which was in the middle of a pedestrian bridge above a river, i walked through a homeless encampment and ended up walking along one of its residents, a man who wore a spiderman mask and carried a large american flag that waived furiously in the high winds that grew more and more intense as we approached the attractor. the man told me that his goal was to show the world that homeless people have value and that they aren't as dark, evil, scary, and disgusting as society often makes them out to be. he was a good soul, a real superhero who persevered through adversities and found meaning in suffering. we parted ways right before the bridge. as i began to cross the bridge, my cell phone rebooted not once, but twice in fairly quick succession - highly unusual. i spent some time at or around where i remembered the attractor point being, but i found nothing of special significance there. it was one of those experiences where there was greater meaning found in the journey than in the destination. happy randonauting everyone!"

mysterious dog,2019-10-28,"i tried the bot for the first time today. used the attractor method, with my intention set to something magical/inspiring. i tried to remain confident that i would find something at the location but a part of me doubted anything would come of my little adventure. i was wrong. i arrived in a quiet neighborhood. the location was inside of a house. this house was the only one on the street decorated for halloween. a husky sat calmly in the front yard, there was no fence keeping him in and no owner in sight. i was sitting in my car across the street and he was staring at me the whole time. never broke eye contact. i was filled with a strong eerie sense that i should get out of the car and walk past the house, but i was too spooked. i sat a little while longer looking at the dog, and then headed home. the really weird thing is that one of my guides for my spiritual practice is a dog, and i have a childhood toy that i still sleep with that is a husky. my brother gave it to me 20 years ago when i was sick in bed. i probably should have gotten out of my car but i wasnt brave enough. next time i will be! p.s. sorry for not having an image, i felt too weird taking a picture of someones house."

first adventure made me smile,2019-10-29,"i just found this subreddit last night so i tried it out today. the attractor point was in someone's backyard, so i just pulled into the cul-de-sac where the house is. one of the cars parked near the house had the same window decal i have, in the same place too. i've never seen anyone else with it! it's a planet express logo from futurama. so just a small thing, but worth the trip."

randonauting is fast becoming more and more intriguing!,2019-10-29,"so after my first experience a few days ago out randonauting and discovering the 'family' frame i wanted to see and learn more. this time my intention was to show me something that will freak me a little. it gave me 3 attractor points all within a very small proximity to one another within a 5 minute walk away. when i got there it was a bunch garages behind the back of some houses. i checked it out but couldn't see anything so decided to take 3 random pictures of the site and i returned home. a little disappointed i decided to check the photos i had taken. on one i zoomed in and it had written on the wall ""beouh!"" ...never heard of it. googled it and a link for a site i used to use 'deviantart' popped up. (i'm a graphic designer and artist.) anyway it takes me to this persons profile and it is weird.... https://www.deviantart.com/beouh/gallery just have a little look through at some of the quotes she's posted and the images?? one caught my eye and it's the image of her fading which quotes ""i'm not real."" the second that caught my eye was her stood on a ledge, quote ""october is suicide month."" i'm not even going to expand on that but it freaked me to say the least on a personal level. i don't know, maybe its nothing, maybe its something? my final attractor point with the intention set as ""show me something to remind me of a passed love one"" - sent me and my friend into the middle of a field where there were no tree's surrounding, just grass. on the exact attractor spot there was a white feather clear as day hanging on to this strand of grass, flickering so it caught my eye. my friend was a little taken back because there was nothing else around, no weeds, no bushes, trees, anything. i then noticed a little while later on the image i had taken earlier in the day which shows the writing at the garages, there is a white feather on the floor!!! so yesterday i notice crows, everywhere. on the grass outside my apartment too. it looked strange because i live in a long apartment block and they were grouped together on the grass outside. six of them. i also notice a card that was bought for me 3 days ago has been sat on my fireplace and i noticed the owl on the front. i had heard people mentioning the owls but didn't look too far into it. so i was in bed sleeping last night and between 3.30am and 3.40am me and my partner were woken up by an owl outside our window being ridiculously loud!! i could not believe it. the last time i even saw an owl was about 8 years ago at a farm i took my cousin to for the day haha. i couldn't see the owl but it was just outside the window so not sure if it was on the ledge above. it happen for a solid 5 minutes or so and then it just stopped, silence and i laid awake for another half hour or so before going back to sleep."
first attractor,2019-10-29,"my first experience, at the exact attractor location i found a dog poo in a bag on the right hand side, and an italian chocolate treat call *bacio*, kiss, on the left hand side of the corner of the alleyway. both brown and pralinated, both wrapped. &amp;#x200b; [dogpoo](https://preview.redd.it/mkb3cv84bgv31.jpg?width=1880&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d491d58d1adfb76f4d8c099bf216a3439cb6c2e6) &amp;#x200b; [bacio](https://preview.redd.it/4b8mwkn9bgv31.jpg?width=1880&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eaf6c94f88605dff32794b8ee3a7984d20d95298)"
proto-randonautical literature,2019-10-29,"hi there randonauts, i recently discovered your existence when a friend sent me a link to this article: [https://theoutline.com/post/7881/i-became-a-randonaut-to-try-to-glitch-the-simulation-and-all-i-got-was-a-bottle-of-pee](https://theoutline.com/post/7881/i-became-a-randonaut-to-try-to-glitch-the-simulation-and-all-i-got-was-a-bottle-of-pee) he thought that i might be interested because i wrote an experimental history book a few years ago that used random processes to locate me in a random location for the ending. so it seems that my book could be construed as ""proto-randonautical"". (i've just googled that adjective, and no one else seems to be making a similar claim, so perhaps it's the *only* example of this?) the book is called *you are here: the biography of a moment*, ostensibly a history of the city of canterbury, but actually the history of how a (randomly generated) single moment of experience came into being. i've been pretty useless at promoting it, but thought it was worth mentioning it here, as you people are much more likely to ""get it"" than the average reader.

the cool mysticism of going random,2019-10-30,"my wife and i have introduced randonaut adventures into our leisure/psycho-spiritual activities. we both enjoy a deep relationship with the great mystery of things and no-things and have found these magickal outings a grand and effortless way of engaging the more cosmic vibe of life. all we have to do is fire up the bot and put on our walking shoes! reading some of the early purveyors of high-weirdness and consciousness raising in the information age, such as robert anton wilson (raw to his fans) and philip k. dick, tuned me into the idea that reality is a malleable construct, like wet clay. what i experience as reality is actually my experiences heavily filtered through my belief system and worldview of the moment. im pretty sure this filtering results in an extremely limited view of life. im also pretty sure that this filtering, allowed to run amok, creates all the depressed and miserable people on the planet. one of the best gifts from raw and those other icons from my early spiritual explorations, was the teaching that i can choose how i experience reality by re-tooling my belief systems and worldview. i can also have a hand in the actual creation (or selection) of my reality by bringing in conscious awareness to that re-tooling process (spiritual practices), which boils down to awakening awareness of the myriad choices i make in a given day. the belief system that i currently hold (very lightly) is draped on my ongoing practice of seeking to align with the velocity of life or finding flow. the lions share of that practice is cultivating a greater awareness of lifes synchronicities that are always just right there, waiting on my attention, letting me know that there is more going on than meets the eye. willingly exiting my current reality tunnel by following a map to a randomly generated attractor point, is a wonderful way to enter that transcendent field where synchronicities flourish and was hinted at by the sufi mystic and poet, rumi. what better way to find that place beyond the ideas of wrong-doing and right-doing, beyond belief systems and worldviews? thanks for creating this transcendent set-up! its a balls up blast!"

plot for randonauts augmented reality game,2019-10-30,"we live in a simulation run by an artificial intelligence. we are attempting to glitch the simulation using a technology known as the fatum bot. the fatum bot utilizes quantum randomness, which is true randomness, and decisions based on it cannot be predicted by the ai. theoretically, by glitching the simulation enough times, we can cause it to crash, freeing humanity from its enslavement. the ai running this simulation attempts to stop our efforts in the form of the despair meme, a term used to describe the resistance from the matrix experienced when attempting to step out of your predetermined probability tunnel. the despair meme not only manifests itself externally, but also internally, from the preprogrammed subconscious mind. the ai and our subconscious fear based programs can be compared to the archetype of the kraken or lovecraftian deity. by facing despair willingly, or rather, facing the kraken with courage, one descends into the belly of the beast, or hades, and undergoes a great transformation. by facing the darkest aspects of ourselves, we will achieve our truest potential, allowing us to save the world. carl gustav jung, the swiss psychoanalyst, once said, a tree cannot grow to heaven, unless its roots reach down into hell. eventually, the fatum bot will be upgraded to allow one to face the despair meme even more intensely, possibly allowing an individual to leave the simulation much sooner than the impending crash. in theory, this will be useful for the group as a whole. if the experiments are successful, brave randonauts will poke holes in reality, weakening the space time fabric, as well as creating gateways for future exoduses. the technology will likely integrate concepts similar to the koren octopus, a helmet used to induce mystical experiences. one will either go mad or achieve enlightenment. nevertheless, there are already randonuats beyond this dimension helping us from the future, and weve been told we will succeed."

magical randonauting,2019-10-30,"attractor intention : magical / power : 2.75 / z-score : 4.05 the intention driven anolamy was around 15 minutes away so i set off immediately. on the way i didn't notice anything unusual, just a random removal van caught my eye on the corner of a road named 'library road' (which reminded me that yesterday i forgot to pick up what i needed from the library!) i was just around the corner from the attractor point when it brought me to a little bridge covered in colourful leaves. i have a weird thing about taking pictures of colourful leaves and plants so i stopped to take a picture - looks great right? magical infact. i carried on for a few minutes when i noticed a grave yard across the road, as i crossed to where the attractor point was it was a row of hedges, nothing stood out. then i noticed this gate, leading through to a field behind the bushes and i decided to climb over and take a look. pheasants!! everywhere! oh and an incredible view which was hidden away. so i stand taking a few pictures, happy with the experience and then all of a sudden my phone freezes on me (2nd time this has happened now out randonauting) it just died on me so i had to end my plans for further randonauting and go home to sort it out. outside my house there was someone moving out and emptying things into a van - hmm just seen a removal van? so anyway as soon as i was inside my phone started working fine??! just had a look through the pictures i took. nothing stood out until i noticed something in the sky. i have no idea if its a bird but to me it doesnt look like a bird at all so why has it randomely shown up in only 2 images? i've added the link below, lemme know what you think see link to images here! https://imgur.com/gallery/fge2n5d"
"found out about randonauting just two days after my first psychedelic ego death, today i went on a first walk",2019-10-30,"last saturday i had a profound and significant experience tripping on mushrooms. i lost complete sense of self (i.e. there were no borders between me, other living things, and inanimate objects, they were all the same thing). i felt as if i was the universe and the universe was me. it was a life-changing experience. it can't be a coincidence that the following monday i found out about randonauting. the concept really resonates with me. i feel that this discovery also is a life-changing event. today i went on my first chain of 5 attractor points. i started at my house and set a radius of 1000m 1. at the exact spot, there was sign that said it was the border between free and paid parking. radius 46m / power 2.70 / z-score 3.92 2. the back yard of an old farm (that is now enclosed in the city), that looked interesting but people were home and i didn't want to trespass. i got in a range of 35 metres of the target but couldn't see it. radius 142m / power 1.47 / z-score: 4.31 3. the fence to someones back yard, in an alley. radius 85m / power 1.72 / z-score 3.75 4. a group of 5 parked bicycles, a girl parked an additional bike at the exact moment i was walking past. radius 96m / power 1.63 / z-score 3.77 5. a mailbox. just 15 metres away from the spot a homeless/schizophrenic person was talking either to himself or an invisible friend. radius 55m / power 2.23 / z-score 3.68 my intention was to see a cat. on my way to the first point, i saw 6 cats. after that, i saw no cats. i believe the meaning of the things i saw will eventually dawn on me but for now i have no clue :') could you guys explain me a bit more about power, z-score and radius and what they mean? or maybe there's an article somewhere that does that? next saturday i will be running 15k with a friend and we decided to let the fatum bot decide where we should go."
first time randonaut,2019-10-30,"so this morning before work, i fired up telegram and got my first attractor. power 4.29 z of 4.21 \[imgur\]([https://i.imgur.com/bfkntaq.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/bfkntaq.jpg)) it popped up next to a singing telegram place, which i thought was pretty odd. \[imgur\]([https://i.imgur.com/llfnqjo.png](https://i.imgur.com/llfnqjo.png)) it wasn't far from my house so i drove over and it was nestled in some small condo cottages. i made my way to the designated visitor parking and it was right by building 13. the number 13 pops up in my life multiple times a day, everyday for as long as i can remember. \[imgur\]([https://i.imgur.com/vbz2rjf.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/vbz2rjf.jpg)) i looked around the area and nothing much caught my attention besides the only registered parking spot in the area i parked had a number \[imgur\]([https://i.imgur.com/h3sfu7l.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/h3sfu7l.jpg)) according to the pin i was still about 30 meters from the pin. the weird thing about this was that no matter which direction i walked it showed me as moving away from the pin. i could not get any closer to it no matter what. anyone else have map issues when doing these?"
"kind of confused still (i researched for an answer, but i want to ask you guys!)",2019-10-30,"hello! i am not new to randonaut adventures, however i have only ever used attractor points and idas, i've never tried a void. what exactly does a void imply? i mean, i get the science behind a ""void"" point, but what does it mean in the world of randonauting? how does choosing a void differ from choosing an attractor? not in a location way, but what is expected at a void location? forgive me if this question doesn't make sense. it makes sense in my head lol."
"first try, completely shook.",2019-10-30,"since this sub has been blowing my mind for a couple days now, i figured heck, i might as well try this myself. first time requesting an attractor, fatum said there were none available and to try again later. eff that, i said -- i'm trying again now. came up with an intention driven anomaly in my neighborhood, .33 miles from my house. i arrived at a house. bad, bad vibes. misery. hopelessness. run down exterior, car in the driveway, by all appearances someone lived there but there was one of those big orange vacant notices on the front door. the kind that the city puts on when a building is inhabitable for whatever reason, usually structural things. i was feeling the doom pretty hard at that point and was drawing the attention of some neighbors, so i snapped a couple pictures and left quickly. i was home less than 10 minutes after leaving. i described the house/area/feeling to my husband and he whispered, ""is that the house where the guy got murdered a couple months ago?"" checked the news stories and sure enough, it was. if anything, my intention had just been to see what this was about and if i'd find anything with meaning beyond minor personal synchronicity. fatum passed the litmus test... now (humbly) onto the next adventure once i clean the poop out of my pants."

"phone goes off twice, pics dissapear",2019-10-31,"so i just found this randonaut -thing yesterday and it sounded so f'cking cool i had to give it a try. i got my first attractor point to a little park few kilometers away. anyway i got there and started look for artifacts (i found what i guess was used mj-pack) but then my phone shut down. i thought the battery was low and i used geolocation it must just be that but today i got attractor point where in the location there was an opened sardine container whit sardines still in it on a park bench. i was not gonna take that with me but i took 3 pics and then boom again, phone shuts down. this time i had battery and once i restarted the battery was like 74%. but the wierdest fucking thing, all those 3 pics of the container were gone. i changed the angle between those pics so it must have had time to save them on the hd. but no, all gone. has anyone else had problems with phone shutting off and pics dissapearing on attractor-points?"

playing the game with just your senses,2019-10-31,"so i want to make this post before it gets too stale. people were posting about their experiences with seeing little portals in trees, one user even had super magical experience of seeing them decorated. should be noted that the little doorways in trees are definitely portals, and have been considered such for hundreds if not thousands of years. i've been playing with this game for about a couple months or so, and i realize that you can play it without actually pulling a location since we're just dowsing in a way already. you just have to turn it on in your mind/heart. so i went to the park nearby the river and started walking and just let my feet go where they would and let my mind just kind of wander and go with it. there's two main paths along the river here, one close to the river bank and one about 40 yards in further. naturally ended up walking somewhere between the two, to increase random path variables. i should note that my intention was loose and more like seeking to find something interesting like an attractor (since this was more or less a proof of concept run). so i'm letting my eyes just kind of fall on what's in front of me and the first thing i see is something that looks like a little sword laying on the ground. i get closer and pick it up and looks like a broken piece of a guitar capo or something. see pic one. so i find this and i'm encouraged - ""okay that's a cool shiny thing, keep going"". now wandering a bit slower through this grove of trees, i see a tree that has a hole the bottom right where the roots meet the ground. so naturally i'm like ""welp, there it is"", so i go to look if there's anything at the foot of the hole, and i and i almost instantly see something shiny. at this point i'm just fully talking to myself. ""ooo, is that a quarter, no wait it's actually 50 cents... no it's 75, a dollar, a dollar 25... i keep counting quarters and moving sticks and debris out of the way until i am holding $3.50 in quarters in my hand. nobody else has walked by me as i'm sitting in front of this tree so i'm just sort of soaking in this experience and i am left wondering a couple amusing things, like what the heck happened that there was a bunch of quarters at the foot of this tree? did the forest and nature spirits just lead me to a bit of shiny? wait, the forest just paid me, so i guess i'll have to pick up random bits of trash that i come across. seriously, i come across an inordinate amount of water bottle caps. no bottles just the caps. so yeah, i hope ya'll enjoy this little tale of how the algonkian fatum monster got me about tree fiddy!"

i went on my first experience but didnt experience anything out of the ordinary...,2019-10-31,"and thats ok! i had fun going to new parts of my city that ive never been to. driving around alone, hiking, and searching were all fun aspects. what i really loved about the experience was that i paid attention to every. single. detail. of my surroundings. i looked for meaning in everything i could, which is something i never pay attention to. looking for meaning in the numbers of the houses i can across, looking for meaning in a rock, or a plant. it was amazingly meditative. actively searching for something with meaning in seemingly meaningless objects was so calming and enjoyable. it made me think about myself, what i am really looking for in life, and what this whole experience we call reality really is. keep on exploring the outside and the inside, randonauts."
photos from adventure undevelopable and strange occurences,2019-11-01,"so, a few weeks ago i had the best luck with a chain of 4 attractor points. for the first time in a while i had multiple cancellations from work. my intention was to find a sign that i was doing okay. i brought my diana f+ with me to take pictures, but should have known the whole adventure was too good to be true. i found my first attractor under a train bridge. nothing noticeable except for construction zone. however the next day a construction worker was hit and killed very close to the point. my second spot was to another set of tracks where there was a mangled child's bike and a rotting pile of fruit. there were a ton of bees swarming the fruit, none the less it was a pretty cool sight. third attractor was a home decorated beautifully for fall. the house number was my daughter's birthdate, and the lighting was exceptional. the final attractor was this tree covered ally that reeked of pot. there was a squirrel eating an apple, and i was super excited for the picture. i sent the film away since there isn't a local spot that develops. i had multiple rolls in my order, and the only roll that came back ""undevelopable"" with no explanation was the one from that day. i'm trying to find a different developer and will update the post if anything changes. &amp; i am terrible at story telling and grammar and spelling"
fake randonaut,2019-11-01,"i told my young kids about randonaut and the premise behind it. they thought it sounded amazing and wanted to try the app. the problem is we live out in the boonies where you can get shot trespassing so after multiple /getattractor answers that put me on other peoples property, i secretly just randomly tapped a spot on the map in our forest (its 90 acres) and said away we go! since its a lot of property, theres many places ive yet to explore. we made our way to the point and it took us deep into a part of the forest weve never been. they were very excited and wondered what we might find once we reached the spot and i had told them sometimes people find a bottle, graffiti or odd items that dont belong in that place. we had to cut through thick brush and suddenly came to this fascinating clearing at the site i had randomly dropped a pin. we walked to the spot and found...a beer bottle! they felt like this was a win and confirmation the app was working, because we were deep deep in the middle of a thick forest and came upon an ancient beer bottle. i found it somewhat odd i had such luck myself. coincidence or conjuration? we explored the area a little and found a tree with mushrooms growing out of it so that was pretty cool too. overall they thought it was a spooky event and i wont ruin the experience by telling them i randomly chose it. ill tell them when theyre a little older.

tried yesterday for the 1st time,2019-11-01,"so i gave this a shot yesterday. i just kinda found out about all of this, i still have a lot of reading and researching to truly grasp the concept, but i got the general idea and im super intrigued. i got it to give me a location to go to, but when i went there, it was impossible to get to the exact dot. i could only get about 100-150ft away from it due to heavy shrubs and whatnot. i looked around for anything interesting or out of the ordinary, but didnt really catch anything other than an empty old milwaukee can littered on the side of the road. i walked a little further south 100ish feet parallel to the point and noticed bushes and trees cut/cleared out going into the woods towards the point, but not cleared out far enough to get to the point. i walked the small path and didnt notice anything really. there was a skinny red vine that hugged a tree to the top that looked kinda cool. thats about it... anyways, i feel like because i couldnt get to the exact location, i failed? do i have the wrong idea of what to expect? if i searched for another location, does that ruin the purpose at all? like i didnt like that choice, so im choosing to have it choose another one for me i went about it all not knowing what to really expect. it was cold, i shouldve dressed better. it was an impulsive mess that left me perplexed on the location because i couldnt get to it. i want to do it again, but more prepared."

very personal coincidences. first time randonauting,2019-11-03,"yesterday i went randonauting with my boyfriend. while we were walking to the attractor point, we saw multiple times the number 21, more than i usually see it. i mention this because during the last 2 years that number has been following me and i see it everywhere. we also saw a bar that we usually use as a meeting point because is near of both of our houses. we have always joked about it's name and it was like a very important internal joke for us. but when i looked to the sign of it where it should be written the name, i see that it had changed. now it's called ""the curious"" and the ""o"" has the shape of an open eye. this shocked me because i setted the intention of the attractor point to ""curiosity"". we finally arrived to the point. it was in a very small orthodox church. we saw that a family was going out of it with a baby because they had just celebrated a christening. nothing weird until i realized that my boyfriend's cousin is pregnant and had a problem with her baby two days ago and she is in a hospital 10 minutes far from the attractor point. i told my boyfriend that that could be a sign that the baby will be born healthy. i'm not superstitious or religious, just trying to comfort him and interpret our experience. finally, we ended up in the hospital visiting his cousin :). what do you think about this? for me it was kind of spiritual and i am starting to believe there is something interesting about randonauting and that i have to keep exploring."
whose mind influence the randomness?,2019-11-03,"in the [experiment #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/randonauts/wiki/theory#wiki_experiment_.232._mind-influenced_randomness), whose mind influence the randomness? if it's the participant's mind, how could the he/she influence quantum events miles away from his/her location? because in the experiments described in [this paper](http://noosphere.princeton.edu/papers/pear/fieldreg2.pdf), the team always put their device around the place where the rituals or events were held to check for anomalies. but if it's the people around the device who affect the randomness, doesn't that make [qrng.anu.edu.au](https://qrng.anu.edu.au/) useless for the experiment? because if it was the people who saw the owl figurine everyday that influenced the quantum events around the reg-1 device and probably made it generate locations where the participants can see owls, then the people who influence quantum events around the device used by [qrng.anu.edu.au](https://qrng.anu.edu.au/) would be anu students and lecturers that we have no idea what they're thinking or concentrating at. that makes the reports collected from the participants who happen to use [qrng.anu.edu.au](https://qrng.anu.edu.au) cannot be concluded and mixing them with the reports collected from the participants who happen to use the reg-1 device compromises the entire experiment data."
this is what a quantum generated run looks like,2019-11-03,"i went running on a chain of attractors and this is what it looks like on strava https://strava.app.link/aegzfugdj1 i set a radius of 2500, starting from my home. upon arrival at the attractor i set the location again and asked for a new attractor. this way i visited seven attractors. my intention was to stay close to my home and not be sent far away. the attractors basically were all within a 3km radius from my home. so that fits with my intent. also, one of the attractors was the house of a friend's parents, and the route took me past my parents' and my brother's house. i wonder what would happen if i use quantum points instead of attractors. would the result be even more random?"

my first randonaut quest w attractor point or breaking my mother out of the matrix!,2019-11-03,"on friday afternoon i planned to stop by my moms house and when i got there she was asleep and not answering the phone or door...so i decided to initiate my first radnonaut quest using an attractor point. my intention was to gain insight into a specific situation/spiritual journey ive been on for 3 years. the first point was at a residence 1101 rose blvd when i arrived there was a man in a ball cap getting into his car. 111 (remove the zero from the address) is significant for my intention and also a man wearing a ball cap is significant although not uncommon so possibly just coincidence. i didnt stay long since it was a residence so i plugged in another point. on the way to the next stop i saw some license plates: god blsng and g sleeve? then i saw a man in a gray/green sweater (g sleeves haha!) the attractor point was at another residence, the house number wasnt significant but in the years was an unusual planter in the shape of a pyramid painted yellow and red. not sure if its significant or not but its noted and i took a picture. since i didnt really get anything that was too specific i decided to plug in a third location. on the way i saw license plates such as daddys girl, king size, watr4lyf (these are only slightly coincidental but noted lol) while i was on my way to the third point my mom called and asked me to come back so i planned to meet up with her after i left the third location. the third location was a park and i had planned on taking my dog for a hike anyways so we proceeded to hike to the third point. the only thing that i saw at the point was a sign that said living on the edge which i thought was kind of interesting. at this time i was getting a weird kind of dizzy feeling like around my eyes and like i felt like i couldnt really focus my eyes very well. i passed by a couple people running or walking on the trails. the only person that stood out to me was a man who was a birdwatcher. the reason why he stood out to me is because years ago i had an intuitive reading that described the person involved in my intention as being like a birdwatcher. i have been thinking about this person while setting my intention for the attractor point and so i thought that was interesting. as i walked around the park i thought that would be a crazy synchronicity if i saw a bluebird because the reader described me as a rare blue macaw that the birdwatcher was searching for and ever since then blue macaws or blue birds in general have been a sign for me. as i walked through the park i actually got lost and so i probably ended up at more random points getting lost! as i exited the park i passed the bird watcher again and because i had my dog with me i made a comment i hope my dog isnt scaring away the birds he chuckled and said they always come back which i felt was kind of significant for my situation that i was intending to work through on this quest. a few moments later a blue bird swooped in front of me! so i go to my moms house and i tell her about the fatum project. she was intrigued and so we decided to go together on another quest. she set the intention to see a glitch in the matrix we ended up going to another chain set of 3 points. the first point was on a street named clearview, right next to the location point was a house that my mom was familiar with bc her brothers ex gf patty lived there when they were kids and she had to break up with her on his behalf when he went to the navy (what the h*ll!??? haha). i never heard that story before. the next point was not really notable except there were some football plaques outside but idk if that is significant to her at all she didnt really make a connection. the third point was really weird! it took us to a cal de sac behind a mall near by also located behind a mall was a church my mom used to go to regular aa meetings at. the point was directly in the center of the cal de sac at a gazebo with mail boxes and just beyond on of the houses in the cal de sac was one of these huge cellular towers that have been sprouting up everywhere. it was such a creepy space and my mom commented that if there was a matrix then this was like a hive for clones. it gets better.....so with all the questing of the day i decide to go home so i drop off my mom and head home. as im on the highway i decide to take a detour in another town and do one more point...the point was in a wooded area between the back yard of some houses and the highway...i didnt feel like trespassing bc it was rainy and cold so i decided to turn around. i got turned around a second time trying to get back on the highway and when i looked up to check out which street i was on it was called clearview!! i called my mom and let her know about the synchronisty of randomly finding another clearview in another town! and we continued to talk about some things between us and we were actually able to clear the air on some stuff w out triggering upsetting emotions (which can be an issue for us at times). it gets even better.....so after all this randonauting and emotionally processing w my mom i finally return home. shortly after that a friend hits me up and wants to stop by after she is finished s grocery shopping. when she arrives she shows me a video of a blue macaw she was talking to at the grocery store! i cant even make this stuff up! its just so amazing how everything came full circle twice and how even the process helped me and my mom! i had such a positive feeling for the rest of the night! thanks for reading!"

"i've always been told i'm a force, but this ""matrix"" thing really is something..",2019-11-06,"so i found this channel maybe a week or so ago after coming here and seeing a story about randonauting; when i started doing all the steps, it took my back to my hometown of where i moved from appx 2 years ago and right in front of where i was living before i moved 600 miles away -\_- (i didn't even go to the place and while i was typing that post, it kept giving my errors, or deleting parts of just weirdness.) i didn't go because it was 600 miles away but just the fact it took me there was crazy. the number i got from the qrng was (333e) - i wish i wouldn't screenshotted but i didn't, and it just gets weirder. 11's have always followed me and is my number but after that post, i youtube'd ""randonauts"" and it was one of the moderators video - @nickhinton333 - idk if that's how you tag on here! anyway, so i always pay attention to any 11's really, like 22 or 33.. and i have for a while followed 333 as well (having to do with papa legba - that's another story). i even did a song containing those numbers ""jazz club 333"". so last night i started watching ""the morning show"" and jennifer aniston wakes up at 3:00 and steve carrel wakes up at 3:30 am. (also a weird time because i always get up at 3 am or around that time.) if you look at my first post before this one, it explains some weird phenomena i've grown and gone through and now this stuff is just really the cherry on top because natural abilities are one thing but when i feel a push or pull of the ""universe"" or whatever it's a whole different ball game. so i closed my laptop and turned on my tv and just picked a random show ""the nanny"", i needed a laugh and wanted to stop 1) thinking of my life lol 2) thinking of the matrix/simulation/ what have you or i'd be up all night. as soon as i press play, a character in the show ""val"" walks in and starts with... ""fran, i just can't believe, i'm 33, single..."" blah blah. i just said ""no fc\*n way."" so i turned off the tv and decided to just try and go to sleep, checked the clock it was 3:33... i decided ""fine, tomorrow i will do my first trip. so besides a wicked lucid dream/astral projection dream - i woke up and something from my dream had happened.. it was stupid but in my dream i dreamt i was at a walmart basically and the girl checking me out went to grab something and i decided to follow her, and she just went towards a bunch of pokemon dolls, then she rotated the thing they were on and she pulled a ""quilava"" - basically a pokemon that i in no way have thought of recently. (sidenote: i play pokemon go - this is important for later). i wake up, check the nearby ""eggs"" and its the same damn pokemon. so i definitely said, ""yes today i will go."" i don't get freaked out much but this was a little weird to me just because the whole day's energy has felt off. i don't drive really so i asked my grandma if she wanted to take my pogo hunting/ explaining to her how we might do the randonaut thing... so we go and start driving until i decide ""okay, time to do this."" i explained to her what to look out for, like signs, songs, license plates, or stuff not working. i originally wanted to go to a nearby bus station to catch a certain pokemon but not enough people were going to attend originally. i started the new app for the qrng and all thru the day it had worked, all of a sudden it was not working. my grandma and i looked at each other and i could tell she was like ""wtf?"" in her mind because she does not believe in this... we check the time.. it's 4:33 and she again was surprised (she knows 11's ""follow"" me). so we still weren't getting a coordinate, but all of a sudden everyone could go to the bus station for that pokemon. right? so we decide okay so lets go to the bus stop... then i felt something just weird like a pull or push maybe... and we get a coordinate.. so now it's do we go to the egg or to the point? it's getting dark earlier here in texas and she can't drive well after that so we just went to the bus stop. i explained to her that we had the choice to the point or the bus stop, but it only happened right at the last minute when our only option was the bus stop. like we waited for 15 minutes for the app to give us a coordinate and before it was giving it to me within seconds. even she felt a little weird and said, ""i guess it doesn't want us to go wherever."" and i said, ""exactly! that's the point! there wasn't a distraction before and now there was. but this has been happening for a while (or ive been trying to make things like this happen) before i found this reddit, like i know there's been times i've just randomly broken a routine and stuff happened and this time it felt like a force just wasn't having it. (another sidenote: i've become very agoraphobic, so i rarely leave the house - however, when i got back to my house today i decided ""f it, i'll walk to the point or run."" and now the app doesn't wanna give me any kind of point -\_- i will try again tomorrow; i want to add a lot of stuff to this story of my past but i might just gather my thoughts and write a post about all my experiences with ""the matrix/simulation"". for example, someone posted a link yesterday that u had been trying to describe to people for the longest about a time i meditated and had an obe and i was flying around a tower, but not a tower more of am mountain/tower of numbers and that's where i got 11's as i was going around this tower i just kept seeing numbers but especially 11's, the 3's came later, and told myself to remind myself, ""numerology, 11's."" i woke up the next morning and researched more of that - then things really started taking a turn in my life. like it doesn't want to be found out. so life just throws a bunch of curveballs. i don't know if any of you have experienced these ""distractions""."

first two randonaut expeditions (no photos yet),2019-11-07,"hi randonauts. i have undertaken two randonaut expeditions over the last two days and wanted to share my experiences. expedition 1 - 6 november 2020 type: attractor radius: 109m power: 1.59 z-score: 4.05 expedition summary hot and windy day. this expedition took me on a hilly walk away from my office into the backstreets roughly 400m away. the marker led me to a pair of very similar (if not identical) old cottages on a narrow street. the cottages are numbered 37 and 39. they were built in 1886 for anton jorgenson, a master mariner. the cottages were named airlie and aldershville. three letters - akr - were engraved into the concrete footpath. the number 77 was sprayed onto the footpath in front of the houses. airlie was a good reminder for me to send well wishes to a relative of mine who lives in a place of the same name. none of the other details were of any real significance. it was fun being taken somewhere i would have never thought to go. expedition 2 - 7 november 2020 intention driven anomaly found type: attractor radius: 57m power: 2.25 z-score: 3.90 another hot, sunny day. i followed the route as the previous expedition but further, down towards some bush land surrounding a small bay. beautiful location and another i would never have considered exploring. i arrived at a path leading into the bushland. i followed the path that led me to a tree-covered clearing with some stone steps heading up a hillside. there was also large house under construction or renovation in the clearing, very close to the marker. construction noises emanating from the house but no one visible. i headed towards a stone stair case to the left side of the house. the marker was slightly off the stair case to the left in the bush land. as i started up the stairs, a dog (medium-sized sheepdog, will look up the breed) rushed up behind me barking. it bounded up the stairs and stopped ahead of me, looking at me with an almost incredulous, wry, what the hell are you doing here? vibe or look. could be in my head. i attempted to be friendly, the dog was neither aggressive or friendly but had unnerved me and blocked my procession up the stairs. i turned around to leave the area as i wasnt sure whether to risk dealing with a territorial dog that was unsure about with my presence. as i walked away, it bounded past and stopped ahead of me again, watching me. i walked past it and away with no further issues. i thought it be best to leave the area. i definitely felt as if it wasnt right for me to be there, possibly due to being dressed in business casual attire wandering around a half-built house in bush land. the dog bailing me up solidified this feeling. interesting expedition for sure."

"i recently have been seeing the number 33 everywhere, but now something just occurred to me that has truly shocked me... (2 minute read)",2019-11-08,"quick backstory: it started when i recently took insterest in the freemasons about 3-4 months ago. as of now, i am going through the application process to become a mason. 33 is not only a very important number to the me, the masons, and others, but a significant number in our world. for example, its a very important number in numerology, there are 33 vertebrae in the spine, 33 degrees of freemasonry, jesus was 33 when he was crucified. i digress. anyway, ive been seeing it everywhere recently. whether it be when i check the clock (1:33, 2:33, 3:33, happens up to 5 times a day sometimes), or when im passing street addresses, its there, at least a few times daily. in fact, i saw it at one of my attractor points today. now though, the fatum bot has made me realize that it has always been a part of my life, i just only recently noticed it. honestly, it creeped me out a little bit, and still does as i write this. anyway, the fatum bot gives coordinations. im now noticing that my current home lies on 33 latitude. coincidence? maybe. but also maybe not... heres where it gets weird: i moved into my current home 4 months ago, about the same time that i gained an interest in the joining freemasons, and when i started noticing 33. my new place is about 75 miles due south from where i grew up. when i noticed that my new place was on 33 latitude, i realized that when i was with my parents (where i first learned about randonauting) last weekend, i had seen that my latitude also read 33. it occurred to me that im about 15 minutes inland from the ocean here, just like where i was when i was growing up. i thought to myself... theres no fucking way... sure enough, i zoomed out on the map and dropped a pin on my childhood home.... 33 latitude. heres some pictures...

question: how many randonauts are also into psychedelics?,2019-11-11,"ive talked to multiple people from this sub, and it seems like many of us share the same interest in the use of psychedelics. i personally microdose lsd, and trip on occasion. i also home-extract and use dmt every so often. how many fellow randonauts also dabble in the world of psychedelics? i ask because there are 3 things that ive found that increase the amount of synchronicities experienced: psychedelics, randonauting, and deep meditation. it seems like a strange coincidence that things used to expand the mind (or third eye) all cause us to experience more synchronicities. let me know what you think!"

"intention was ""future""",2019-11-11,"i was visiting my boyfriend this weekend. we were going for a walk, so i suggested we allow fatum-bot to determine where to walk with the intention of the future. my ""set-up"" was: intention: future radius set to 1111m /getattractor[3] as i typed this i thought about asking for just two locations as a symbol of us being a couple. still, i asked for three locations, but i only received two. this was very odd, but i thought maybe a glitch could explain this. anyways, we started heading to the suggested locations. the first one was around 50 feet away of his house in his neighbor's backyard. we couldn't access the location, but i noticed from afar what looked like statues in a beautiful garden. we moved on to the second location, which was a little further on the other side of town. it took us to a swamp. we could hear kids playing and screaming. this location was also fenced, so we couldn't really access the exact location. we decided to just keep walking and head to the city. at this point, we were closer to the next train station (which we had never been to before and its completely new). as we get on the train, we noticed a couple and their child sitting right across from us. the child is laughing and looking and me. the mom then tells me that her child has a coat that looks just like mine and she loves it! my bf and i love kids so we are both so cuted out by the little girl. we get off the train and walk around the city for a while. after a couple of hours, we saw a primark and went inside, because i had never visited one before. then, right there, we met the couple and their child once again, face to face. the woman says: ""what are the chances?!?"". we all laugh about the encounter and move on. later that night, i was thinking about the complete picture of the day. see, every coincidence is meaningful to me, and that's when i realized.... they are our future. first, our intention was always the ""future"". we only got two locations, because if there were 3, we would have visited all of them, leaving us out of the time frame to coincide with them on the metro. then, everything we did during our time in the city led us to the unique time frame when we would have met them again, to reinforce the message. lastly, a random thought that i had when we first encountered them: they are an interractial couple, like us! :) this randonauting trip did not seem meaningful at all, until i saw the complete picture!"

'nauting in the woods,2019-11-13,"i've tried a few times to get an attractor that i can get to, and after being sent off to places i can't access (all fields behind hedges / fences), i rethought my approach. i'm trying to remember some of the smaller details of the last two, so bear with me if i waffle. 1: i did a small journey over the weekend just to see what happened, with no particular expectations and to pay attention to any signs along the way. the attractor did the same thing as before, and pointed me to a field a couple of miles away. i took my son (five years old) and hopped into the car along a single track country lane. as i drove, a squirrel ran in front of me, so i braked and my boy told me to drive slower (he's normally telling me to speed up), i did and saw three magpies fly away from me - i was rushing toward the location again. we got to the edge of the attractor point (behind a hedge with nowhere to park up and investigate) and i drove slowly as we discussed if there was anything interesting that we could see through the hedge. there was nothing but a single huge oak that my boy kept talking about and as i drove away, it stayed in view. i realised the road was bending around the field, and it stayed in view for ages. i think i understood what this means. i questioned why the attractors are always out of reach, and came to the conclusion that it's about the need for me to break certain barriers. this is something i know, but i get distracted by life. i think it's a ""5/10 try harder"" message to me. 2: i decided to find an attractor on the way home from work today, with the intention of finding something interesting (not necessarily physical). i drove slowly through woodland as there are often deer or pheasant that run across the road, then stopped and set the radius to 1000. the area is really beautiful, and away from the main road. now that autumn is here the whole area is brown, red and golden, and i take this route most evenings as i find it more rewarding than the shorter route along the main road. despite being nearly home, telegram gave me an attractor near to where i work, which is 20 or so miles away from where i was parked up. i know the area pretty well as i go for a run in my lunchbreak (again this is in the middle of a field, but it's open - i'll check this tomorrow), i suspect the map glitched due to data dropout, despite me still streaming music over my android (still fighting it by ben folds). i tried again and got a nearer location on the opposite side of the wood. i turned the headlights back on on the car and caught a glimpse of gold at my side - it looked a bit like someone in a party coat hiding by a tree, but closer inspection showed me it was a partially deflated helium balloon caught in the lower branches. i'll check the balloon out on the way to work in the morning. any bets on the number? now, i'm a chaos magician and a bushcrafter and i've spent a lot of time outdoors in various situations and in various states, and part of the reason i chose to do both of these was to challenge certain fears i had and to take myself out of my comfort zone. however, i didn't want to get out of the car here tonight. i'm as comfortable in these woods as i am in my home, and i often stop at this location to walk off the working day before i go home (i'm that weirdo who walks around woods at night without a dog because i find it interesting), but tonight i actually felt like i needed to lock my doors (which i did). i felt my first hint of danger in possibly years, and i'm genuinely not the type to get freaked by shadows. i found myself looking around to see if there was anyone watching me. so i drove, and arrived at the area telegram had given me - it was a road i've driven past several times without noticing (and a nice future shortcut home i think). it took me to a small residential area with a right of way through it, a bridleway for horses leading into the wood. i parked up and started walking. as i get to the edge of the attractor my phone starts freaking out, with the map spinning around and not being able to fix in one position. there was no light other than the light from peoples houses. i can make out the path ahead, which leads off into the woods, and i get the same fear as before. this is serious goosebumps. i'm not ashamed to say i wimped out and turned around. the clouds then passed by and the moon suddenly lit everything up - the pathway was instantly visible ahead of me and i looked around to see the same behind me, leading into the darkness of the woods. i got back into the car (locking the doors again) and started driving immediately. i think i got within 30 - 40 metres of the attractor centre, but didn't want to go any further. it felt like i was being watched and i shouldn't be there. it was really interesting to feel a feeling that was incredibly primal and well worth exploring again."
what do you think the owls mean?,2019-11-13,"never, in my entire life of living at my house, have i ever heard owls outside (i've moved in and out for 27 years). i may remember hearing one or two when i was little but not since then. less than a week ago i tried the fatumbot for the first time, then a couple nights ago i hear an owl as i'm coming inside after getting home from work. but this terrifying feeling came over me as if i were being watched.. and the first thing that came to mind were the watchers in the matrix movies. you know, the guys in suits? is there any chance of something like this maybe? i know i've heard owls represent mystery and parallel universes and such.. maybe i sound crazy idk.. lol just wondering what people thought."
"first time, help interpreting please!!",2019-11-13,"last night i was telling my friend about randonauting and how i hadn't gotten myself to go yet. she was excited about it after she did a little digging and we decided to download the bot and just get one location each. mine seemed unremarkable, just in an alley that i pass frequently during my commute. her's... well it was the address to her old apartment building. we were shook. so we pulled more spots, figuring we would chain and make a night of it. we had similar intentions: empowered future, enlighten love, and guidance from the universe. slightly different but along those lines. what we saw rocked us. her phone would glitch at nearly every location and i had a sinking feeling in my stomach. even people we encountered (granted it was about 11pm in the city when temps were well below freezing) seemed to be robotic. no eye contact, a man even continued to cross a road while i was driving to the point where i thought he may just keep walking into my slow vehicle. i have attached my album with just a few pics of the night. my first spot had a mural of two people in the hands of what would be an other worldly being, perhaps a god or the simulation itself. when my friend and i walked up on it there was a sec of silence before we both felt this gut wrenching, pit of your stomach anxiety. that feeling stuck with me for the rest of the night. we found other symbols too like ""stay in the fight"" which i think is also refence to the washington nationals play off push, weird being dc is my home town and this city is 2000 miles away. additionally we found a garage with what looks like an animals footprints on it. all in all it was a weird night. since it was both our first, could you add any guidance/interpretations to these signs? happy questing! our first time randonauting https://imgur.com/gallery/93tkyry"

i know where the answers are...,2019-11-16,"i ran the search while my boy was swimming and we went straight after his class. the intent was to find somewhere accessible. set the radius to 1000 and it gave us a 2.5 power attractor that was just around the corner from where we were, to a trail in a small woodland trust area. [just follow the arrow...](https://preview.redd.it/cox1he1ad2z31.jpg?width=2777&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc88502d39ca56d7e2394aa20fc9495f7a3df4e4) one of the signs around the area had fallen off, and someone had tied it back onto the tree with vine. someone had written the note, which made me chuckle - it felt like the cosmic joker was at play. the attractor was away from the track, and we had to push through brambles and nettles to get to it. right in the centre was an oak (oak and holly seem to be the consistent elements for me), with a small bag sitting at its base. the bag was covered in moss and mildew, and i opened it to find an old tent - no poles, just the covering. i'm guessing this was a homeless persons base for a while, although it's about 5 miles from town. whether this was significant or not, i don't know, but it was kind of cool. [the mysterious bag](https://preview.redd.it/sfih3qtzh2z31.jpg?width=2777&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a880396096c055a2976e43a9eaa1d15aeea5d04d) we carried on walking, and saw a load of trees with the number 8 sprayed on them. after a short fight with sticky buds, we came to an arbour called robin hood, and carried along the trail to a managed clearing with a small plantation of saplings. we investigated mushrooms, thistle and various saplings and we looked up to see two female red deer watching us, they ran into the area where the attractor was. i'm in two minds whether to go back and pick up the bag. we decided it was time to go home, as we were well past lunch and both of us turn into arseholes when we are hungry, so we made our way back to the trail, past a board that had some graffiti on it. i looked at it and noticed a faded note on it: [\\""i've lost my childhood!\\""](https://preview.redd.it/6icdlegnh2z31.jpg?width=2777&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a479100b98e6430d26013ceab5cd2372f1f46c77) this message has been a recurring theme with me as an adult, i lost both of my parents when i was young and had an extremely restrictive christian upbringing; it sometime feels like i missed out on a normal childhood. however, today i was with my son, and he pretty much buzzed on everything we saw - it made me smile rather than feel sad."

few months ago. mystery stones.,2019-11-23,i went for a solo randonauting and stumbled upon incredible things hundreds of meters in the hills behind my shop. randonauting of the 17/06/2019. mystery stones https://imgur.com/gallery/xoxxgmv
my first trip showed me how pretty my town is - power: 0.67,2019-11-23,"i met an old friend with whom i used to be intimate. i was struck by longing - i hadn't seen him for more than a year - and i intuitively decided to randonaut about such friendships. of course, a dumb and useless intention could only lead to nothing. the attractor point was placed in the middle of a forest, so i couldn't access it (in south america they are really dense). although i did see a path leading into it, i didn't know if it would take me to the attractor point and i was still unprepared. anyway, i saw some interesting stuff when going there. the most relevant one was an sprite ad saying ""obey your thirst"" (jesus christ...). moreover, i used to think my town was really ugly, but going to that forest made me change my mind. there were lots of butterflies, and i even saw a goose! i didn't know these existed here. here's an imgur album with pictures: [https://imgur.com/a/chyxezi](https://imgur.com/a/chyxezi)"
first trip today,2019-11-23,"i set an intention of something i need to see and hit attractor. first place it led me to was an apartment complex and i was extremely confused as apple maps makes it hard to know exactly where the point was. so i got out of my car and walked until the exact moment it said arrived - i was smack dab in front of a car. it was a silver lincoln with an army sticker and a license plate that read jefrson intrigued, and wanting to know more, i decided to get another attractor point. it led me straight to jefferson labs. the cebaf - the continuous electron beam accelerator facility. i saw a blue and yellow fire hydrant next to the building like i see in some of the posts here. now, the weird part is - university of virginia was my dream school back in the day (thomas jefferson founded it) but i couldnt go due to life circumstances. i still cant as it is so it ended up making me really sad. i even saw a tree with g5 etched into it and upon looking this up was led to the us department of education website. all in all was very strange everything lined up this way. definitely will go again another time and hope itll be more of an uplifting experience."

"i'm telling you, that rooster had it for me.",2019-11-24,"ok, so- i got an attractor with a 6.62 power and a z-score of 4 (no idea what that means, but let me feel clever ok?). i was feeling antsy at home, so i put on my boots and headed to this completely random location in the middle of the forest, about 2 km away from my house. nothing to report about the way there, aside from the fact that at one point i thought i had to sacrifice a lung for the greater good. the climb to this place is no joke. one i reach there, lo and behold a bunch of nothing. i mean, if i was meant to find a tree then i succeeded in my task, but if i wasnt...then i mustve missed something. google maps was buzzing at me, telling me i was there, but all there was were old rotting tree stumps and stones. pulled my trusty zoom out, recorded a minute or two, took a few pictures, the usual ritual. the intention was to be shown something i had to know. not gonna lie, i was looking around this place and there was nothing to give me an aha! moment. so, like the modern creature that i am, i pulled out my phone and started looking for a shorter way back home. a few seconds later, out of nowhere, a freaking rooster starts crowing. it crows 3 times, spooks me enough to almost drop my phone, raises all the hairs on my arms, and then like the absolute boss that he was, shuts up. what do i do? curse like a sailor, apologise, and sprint back home. on the way back i found leaves. dont roll your eyes at me, i know i was in a forest and shit, but these three particular ones were curved and filled with rain water. i looked to see if there were any others, but nah, just these three ones. they were also close to one another, all in about one meter radius. i know what youre thinking cause i read those books too, but i didnt drink from them (i mightve taken two of them with me because im stupid like that) all and all, not something special, but it made for a good afternoon walk."

first attractor - into the woods,2019-11-27,"my girlfriend and i decided to give randonauting a go earlier this afternoon. after deciding on the intention of ""discovery,"" we received an attractor point with a power level of 3.07 and a z-score of 4.34. it lead us into the woods behind a nearby seminary. while on our way to the attractor point, we came across a white-tail buck. my girlfriend has never seen one so close, so she was excited and believed that the intention of ""discovery"" was answered with this new discovery for her. the deer watched us for a bit as he was eating before eventually turning and walking away. the actual attractor point was within probably 50 yards of the deer; we found a chainlink fence with a gate, which was opened. i frequent these woods a few times a month, but never in the area of the attractor point. i usually hear owls when i am there at dusk. i requested a second attractor point after this (power level 5.08 and z-score 4.51), and it took me to a small creek near the previous attractor point. on my way here, i found another chainlink fence; this one had been smashed by fallen trees. i also discovered a log tied to a tree. the actual attractor point ended up being a few feet away from the smashed fence, but did not appear to have any obvious significance. overall, interesting experience. we discovered a few interesting things along the way. the chainlink fences that were opened and smashed may be a sign. here is a link to the pictures: [https://imgur.com/a/swcswcs](https://imgur.com/a/swcswcs)."

a question about the randomness/quantum uncertainty in the locations generated by the bot (versus being another form of determinism),2019-11-29,"one fundamental concern i had about the project (as interesting as it is to me) is this: even if i don't volitionally choose the spots i go to when randonauting (ie because software is providing the coordinates to me), is this not another form of determinism, ie what led me to find out about randonauting, and what led that particular spot to be chosen by the bot, etc.; isn't that another form of plain causality and determined fate, as opposed to free will? i've read through the ""start here"" materials that seem to address this question, and my understanding is that the problem of hard determinism is overcome by using a quantum number generator as part of the location-generating process. perhaps i don't know enough about quantum number generation, but to cut to the chase, my question is: what makes this different than a pseudo random number generator (ie where does the observer effect come into play, how is the chosen number not already predetermined)? i should add that i find the idea of the experiment very interesting, and have enjoyed the two experiments i've made"

broadening the experiment,2019-11-30,"it occurred to me just now: why limit the experiment to geographical exploration? the example i have in mind is this: use the uncertainty generator to select from either a binary (this/that or yes/no outcome) or multiple choice proposition. it could be used for seemingly trivial and objectively harmless decisions of the same magnitude of the current experiment's use of going to this or that location. for example: while dining out, i pick two items on the menu and use the generator to decide for me. et cetera. maybe opening up new tunnels. worked love your thoughts. if this is ground that's already been covered in the literature, my apologies."

1st randonaut outing: neat synchronicities,2019-12-04,"link is album of pictures from the outing. i just discovered rondonauts yesterday morning and was immediately fascinated! i downloaded the podcast and checked out the site and bot. i finished up work early and decided to give it a shot. the bot gave me coordinates that seemed to be in the middle of a field which would require me to hike in the snow a bit. it was a sunny colorado afternoon so i went hiking. i parked as close as i could get to the target, about half a mile away. getting out of the car i found out i was at a nature preserve that i hadn't been to, so already the journey was worth it. i had to walk down the preserve trail for a bit before i had to deviate off trail and into a protected grassland for about 200 yards. i was already buzzing with a bit of nervous excitement but ultimately decided to trek into the field. as i'm approaching a place to go of trail a woman riding a huge black horse past me, and thought that it was something worth noting. the walk through the field was beautiful, it was quiet, birds were singing, and rabbits were running. i got to the attractor point and there seemed to be nothing there, the snow was about ankle deep so i could have missed something. i snapped a picture of the location and headed back, a bit nervous that i might be greeted by a ranger or official but all was good. the walk back was even more pleasant because i was facing the mountains at sunset and at this time the hawks were circling for field mice. i get back to my truck feeling calm and with the type of alertness that only being outdoors and observant can give you. i sit in the truck, take a deep breath, and look in front of me. hanging on the tree right in my line of sight was a glove! i was listening to the podcast that morning and they talked about how lots of randonauts find gloves. it wasn't there when i got out there and was placed on the tree as if it was wearing it. i take a picture then go back in my album and look at the picture of the attractor point, the picture had two orb-like artifacts in it. i understand that these are probably ice particles as the temperature was dropping as the sun was going down, but it made me think of the idea of attractors as portals. i then set my phone down, looked at the clock and it is 4:44pm. it was a short journey and nothing super amazing happened but just getting out and taking a walk, paying attention to my surroundings, and doing something unknown and spontaneous was fantastic! i will absolutely keep randonauting and hope to organize a community here, ft. collins, co btw. side note: i already have experience with synchronicities, magickal thinking, nature scrying, jungian psychology, etc. so this idea was immediately appealing to me."
"/getattractor.9 montpellier, peyrou - 04.12.2019, afternoon",2019-12-04,"hi, (sorry for the mistakes, ive been living in france for the last 20 years of my life, not used to writing in english..) this is my first post on r/randonauts. ive been on a few randonaut outings before, getting attractors in my spare time, ending up in strange places i never wouldve thought of going to (been posting them on [my blog](https://vagueplots.hotglue.me/), all in french though, sorry :/). ive decided to post here today because the fatum bot is taking more and more place in my life, to the point that ive been building up a project in which it has become the central tool. i finished my art studies last june, and part of my work at the time was about what i called in-between spaces, people living there, and how you find them. when i discovered r/randonauts i was thrilled the project mentioned above is simple : ive moved to a town in the south of france a couple of months ago - and discovered the fatum bot around the same time-, and have been walking around quite a bit. i found a book written in the 70s at the library, in which the author - monique dur - describes and tells the story of different parts of the city. im going to go to each of these places, and activate the fatum bot, see where it leads me to. the idea is to create some kind of a dialog with the book, between two peoples points of view at two moments in time. heres my first outing : *the bot wont generate an attractor for some reason. yesterday it did the same thing. however it finds a blind spot. off we go. i begin my quest in the middle of the peyrou parc, between a statue of a king, and a water tower. at the moment the park is under construction, i had to make my way around the barriers blocking the way to the central trees. their trunks were surrounded by red tubes. to get to the blind spot, i have to walk around the other side of the barriers. autumn leaves have covered the surface of the ground, and you can hear the sound of pickaxes digging out its soil.* *pretty quickly, a pattern surfaces. everywhere, patches of blue : graffiti on trees, pavements, and walls, echoing with construction worker markings ; temporary blocks contours ; doors and window panes ; stickers on floor lamps ; baskets in piles of trash ; tarpaulin hanging down from scaffolding. as i walk to my goal, i collect pictures of these blue marks, they are now leading the way.* *the blind spot has appeared in a residential building. i cant enter. however, above the door, in big letters, i read the name of the residency : franceze de cezelli.* *her name allows me pursue my quest for a bit longer. i do a bit of research on my way home : turns out franoise de cezelli was the governor of leucate, a fortress built at the frontier between france and spain, from 1586 to 1616. at the time, there were religious wars all around europe, and soon enough the spanish army and the catholic league laid seige to the fortress. franoise de cezellis husband immediately left the fortress to get help, only to be captured and jailed on his way. during his absence, franoise de cezelli defended leucate, said shed rather die than surrender. when the spanish army and catholic league finally let it go, the king of france named franoise de cezelli governor of the place of leucate, which she was for the next 27 years of her life, until her son took over.* so this was quite a nice concidence, considering monique durs book is one about the history of a town, told via its buildings, statues, parks, etc. turns out the blind spot brought me to a place that could have been in her book, had the author lived a little longer (i reckon the franceze de cezelli building appeared after the 70s. maybe not though?) i really enjoyed finding this blind spot, and learning from it. have any of you guys started using the fatum bot as tool for a bigger project ? has it taught you the story of a place ?

intention: an opportunity,2019-12-05,was back in my home town for thanksgiving and wanted to show my dad the idea of randonauting. i asked him what the intention should be and he said an opportunity. our plan was to go to an attractor point and then check out the new corner market that opened up in town. the attractor was on the east side of town in the middle of a road. when we arrived at the attractor we got out and looked around but didnt really see anything worth mentioning. so we left and went to the corner market. when we got there my dads bank account manager was there and this came as a surprise to my dad because he was trying to get ahold of him by phone earlier that day! this saved him the time of trying to contact him later and they were able to discuss everything they needed to right then and there. seemed like a pretty good opportunity to me and thought it was worth sharing! peace

first time randonauting. very interesting finds!,2019-12-05,"a few days ago i went down to the lake near my house and was climbing on these rocky cliffs when i found three spiral shells that i never find on this lake i only ever find a clam shells in the shells were right next to each other and nowhere else within the mile and a half i probably walked. (i never picked up the spiral shells to bring them back home because i didnt have any bag to carry them in and i was planning on going back down to grab them but hadnt gotten around to it yet) fast forward to today i decided to randonaut for the time. i went into the room of my mom and said i was going exploring. she gave a few joke guesses as to where i was going or what i was doing and the last one that she said was rock climbing (keep in mind). i went to my room to use the bot to find the attractor point. the first time doing it i had forgotten to set my intention so i scrapped it, but by using the google maps satellite i saw that it was somebodies house so i wouldnt have been able to go there anyways. so the second time doing it i decided to set my intention before hand and i didnt do anything specific but i was just thinking in my head of some magical images that make me feel good and one of the main images that my brain kept getting stuck on were those three spiral shells that i saw at the lake a few days before that i never went to pick up. when i opened my eyes to see what point the bot had come up with it was right by where the shells were on the lake and i was wondering if it was actually the exact spot where the shells were (this is just about .2 miles from my house. ) so i went down to find the point and to get there i have to climb a bunch of very steep rocky cliffs which is interesting because my mom joked that i was going rock climbing. right before i got to where the shells were this bluebird (maybe a blue jay. it had a white belly) flew by me chirping (the first time that i came to the spot where i found the shells the exact same bird flew by me chirping at the exact same point that i was standing. i remember because i had never seen that bird near that area before and it really stood out to me because it was really pretty). i picked up the spiral shells that i had found a few days before to take them back to my house, the attractor point was a little bit farther than where the shells were so i kept going. i finally got to the attractor point and at the exact spot was this really large bird feather. (i hadnt seen a single bird feather the entire walk down there or the entire walk home and i took a different, longer path home, and im always looking out for them because i like to collect them). and a few steps down were about five more of these spiral shells that were really pretty. the shells as well as feathers are signs in general, theyre different for everyone. but for me it like a hey, we see you. and we know that you are beginning to see us. continue on the path youre on. this was a super interesting first experience. cant wait to continue."
generated lots of locations at work. went on my first journey afterwards,2019-12-06,"so i learned about randonauting the other night from a podcast. r/tinfoil hat pod. as i dove into it deeper and deeper i became more and more curious. so when i was about 15 mins, away from leaving i did a scan for attractor points. i followed it and got to a field that was surrounded by barbed wire. i got as close as i could to the exact point,(maybe 30 away) and had an attractor location generated. i followed that one and came to a sub station. near the sub station was a sign. it had a 888 number on it and said drug and alcohol addiction, which im struggling with right now. so i used that make today my first complete day with out a drink or a hit of weed."

"""this week has been a bad massage, i need a happy ending"" - kanye west, 'gorgeous'.",2019-12-06,"to start off, i was getting bored at work today and decided to generate a few blind spots. a mystery point led me to a 'physiotherapy' centre where i had actually thought of coming a month back because of a persistent muscle tightness in the hamstring and calves but i ended up going to a thai spa instead. when i saw the location on the map i realised i was planning to go this place but never made it. since the muscle tightness has still been persisting i decided to just go to the 'clinic'. the clinic was definitely a blind spot as you had to go through a gas station to go there and the sign outside read ""gym"". when i went inside i realised the place was shady as hell. the receptionist tells me that the physio is not there but she can give me a full body massage with herbal oils. surprise, surprise the physiotherapy centre is actually a shady massage parlour. i was like, i have already come here so why not. as the title suggests it was a blissful massage. i kind of felt funny that the bot led me there. p.s. - also on an unrelated note, i was into almost 180+ days of semen retention (which i had been doing for other purposes)."

(three for a girl, four for a boy.) the homeless woman wasn't in the usual spot, and it turned out the point was a bit further on, anyway. just as i got to it, a big issue seller approached me (homeless person selling a magazine). i gave him the money and he thanked me. third time i was out, first time finding the spot involved an interaction with someone. my intention, after getting suggestions from the bot, was ""lightmen"". not sure what it means, but i feel ok about this one."

atoms.slips.scars,2019-12-09,"this is my first new post on here in many months. it's not that i haven't been randonauting - i have a backlog of photos and stories going all the way back to this summer. i began a journey at that time and have found myself at the end of that journey. the first void i ever travelled to/through was back in july; the void was one street over from me, so at the time i went for a simple walk around the block. i recall a distinct blue house at the exact point of that void. today, i decided to try a scan for anomalies, a feature i had not tried yet. i was thinking about time slips while the scan was taking place. an intention driven anomaly void was generated, very close to where that aforementioned ""july"" void was. rather than walk around the block as i had done back then, i drove around the block because winter has descended upon my fine city and we've already got lots of snow. the power level for this void was 5.01 and it had a radius of 24m. in addition, three words were produced by fatum-bot: atoms.slips.scars - these words meant nothing to me at the time but they are significant nonetheless. i got in my car at 12:09 pm and started to drive around the block. i went nice and slow, i was in no hurry, because the sun was making a very rare appearance. i was thinking about how much i want peace for our world. as i drove down the street, i searched for that little blue house i had seen over the summer, where my first generated void was, yet i did not see the house. surely i simply missed it. i turned the corner and pulled up in front of the house where today's void was generated. there was nothing special, just someone's snowy front yard. there was a fence around their house with what appeared to be faded writing or symbols of some kind - i did not snap a photo of this fence, but certainly could at a later date and add it to this post. anyways, it didn't seem like anything out of the ordinary, and i drove back around the block back home. normally, my awesome wife goes out and randonauts with me, but today she had to work - she is a paramedic and works in our city. she ended up having an absolutely insane day, which of course she told me about when she got home around 6 pm. it turns out, at the exact time i went out to visit this void, 12:09 pm, she had the most challenging call of her young career: her and her partner were on their way to a call when a man ran out into the street and flagged their ambulance down. they pulled over to help him and noticed he was gushing blood from his leg: he had been shot and had an arterial wound. he was bleeding so much, he would have died had they not been at that spot, at that time. atoms.slips.scars - this happened on adams st., my wife said the blood was extremely slippery, and this man will certainly have scars. she was more freaked out about this set of words than i was - as such i felt compelled to share this story. the synchronicity of it all... at the exact moment i am travelling to a void and thinking about peace, my wife is saving the life of a wounded man and being tested like she's never been tested before. ying and yang. happiness and sorrow. life and death. peace and war."
first outing today...,2019-12-09,"first outing today... set my intention as truth/knowledge... have been learning a lot about who/what we are and why we are alive my name is christopher and my whole life ive always been asked to be called christopher but everybody calls me chris... first point generated and some graffiti caught my eye. big red letters it said chris is mine... felt it was a reminder that im owned by the elite in this simulation... next point generated took me to an insanely large hedge trimmed into a perfect cube... been learning a lot about the time loop weve been trapped in. this cube confirmed to me im on the right path to escaping... im new to reddit, using mobile. want to add a picture of the cube its almost unbelievable...."

black cats,2019-12-09,"went on my first mission this weekend, despite the icy conditions in the frozen wastelands of the north-west of england. i love the concept of randonauting; even when on holiday i tend to zig-zag from place to place rather than following a pattern. i had a little difficulty finding the place but in doing so got to see parts of the town i'd never seen before. there was nothing unusual to report at the destination, although there were some weird trees that seemed to sprout with 2 or 3 trunks rather than the usual one. i'd never seen those before but they looked pretty natural. overall i enjoyed the experience, especially as it forced me to look closer and scrutinise the environment more which was an interesting exercise. on the way back i thought to myself that the simulation had managed to render that part of town pretty well! which then caused me to think about the term 'a glitch in the matrix' and how they'd represented it with a black cat in the movie. that, in turn, got me thinking about why black cats are considered lucky. some seconds later a tubby black cat emerged from under a parked car and darted away. of course, cats are very common pets and it wasnt exactly synchronous but i took it to be significant."
i went randonauting to find something to give me some guidance,2019-12-09,"im in a weird position where idk what i want to do with my life but i learn something and make money, whether it be through school, online courses, or doing something on my own, either way im tryna start the path to my career. recently i went randonauting to find some sort of guidance and it led me to a business area off some main streets and i found a culdesac. i drive a 370z and have been interested in drifting for sometime so right away i knew it was somewhere i could practice drifting and get a feel for my car. the next day i came back to the spot with my brother, he has a c6 corvette, and we found another guy down there doing donuts. i drove past him and went to the culdesac and started doing donuts (wide donuts that go around the whole culdesac) and i noticed he came to see, i was still drifting and he hopped in. it was my first time drifting and first time having someone join in and it gave me such a crazy rush. my brother isnt that good, hes older but hes still learning. this guy from ifunny told me about initial d and it just motivates me to want to learn more and be better. point is idk if this is a sign of what i should do. ive always been interested in cars so i feel like i should choose a career that has to do with them but i also dont have much confidence in myself bc i know there is a lot of competition in trying to own a successful shop of some sort"

has anyone else noticed any small coincidences in their everyday lives ever since they started randonauting?,2019-12-09,"over the last few weeks ive noticed a lot more cars like mine on the road. not just same type of car, but same year, same model and same color too. and its becoming a lot more frequent, like around 3-4 times a day now. just something weird i wanted to share, its happening enough for me to take notice."
self realization,2019-12-09,this isnt really a randonaut post but i feel like this is the type of community i wanna have a conversation with. ive had so many moments of synchronicities for the past month and life feels very magical. i just wanna know if anyone else is on this wave.

setting intention for physical things?,2019-12-10,"hey, has anyone else tried searching for physical things? how did it go? background: i've randonauted three times before tonight, each time with an abstract or vague concept in mind (rewards, peace of mind, and something to make me laugh). each time, i found something matching those criteria at the destination. the first time i randonauted, i found a dollar bill someone had dropped, so i figured i'd set my intention as ""money"" to see if it could lead me to a bit more loose change. instead, it led me to an empty ally way. i searched the ally, but there was no literal or obvious metaphorical money there. however, on the way there i did see a poster for a missing dog for which the owner was offering a monetary reward, that i wouldn't have seen otherwise, so i set my intention for that specific dog, in hopes that i would find it, receive the reward, and thereby fulfill both intentions at once. this second intention led me to a walkway with no dog, although a house nearby did have some statues of chinese guardian lions, so i guess that's kind of dog-like. anyway, seeing as this experience is the first time that i've come up completely empty handed, i currently hypothesize that randonauting only works for abstract things or broad categories, and not specific objects, individuals, or places. however, i'm curious if anyone else has tried searching for specific things, and if so, did you successfully find it (or something similar)?"
randonauting changed my life!,2019-12-10,and its so huge that its gonna take so long to type out but i swear its bigger than i ever thought... i randonauted on my own on thanksgiving day and profound changes have happened affecting every level of my life and consciousness since then. my mind is honestly blown. i had no idea it was this powerful... cant wait for 12/22 with everyone
a random adventure w owl spotting despite no anomalies per my intention,2019-12-10,"so last night i was bored and decided to locate some random points based on an intention. after a few requests to the fatum bot i was unsuccessful at generating any points so i said f*ck it ill just drive around....eventually i ended up seeing a bunch of synchronicities related to my intention and then decided to see a movie. the movie even had a few synchronicities as well! on my way home, i was the only car on the highway and a huge owl swooped right in front of my car but i didnt hit it! it was so fast i couldnt even break! and it was huge!! im taking this as a sign that ive successfully hopped into the timeline that is in alignment with my intention! any thoughts??"
does this work now? last time i checked it wasn't actually producing true random numbers,2019-12-10,i forgot all about this until now so i'm checking back in. does it work again?
